[crowd roars] [Fluffy] Whoo! Oh, man! That’s a long walk. [laughter] Thank you so much, Houston. [crowd cheering] One year ago, this city was flipped upside down by a hurricane, un cabrón named Harvey. [laughter] And they said that this city would never be the same. I think it’s beautiful that, a year later, we’re all here celebrating together the fact that this city is resilient. And you guys persevered. Houston’s strong, baby. [crowd cheering, applauding] That’s serious. In all sincerity, guys, I’m not trying to kiss your ass. I already got your money. [laughter] Freaking Houston. I love this town. I’ve been coming here for 20 years. Twenty years. Started off performing at a comedy club called The Last Stop. [cheering] And then, of course, we jumped over to the Improv, and then– I performed everywhere. I even did a one-nighter in Tomball. [laughter] That’s a long story for the people at home. I won’t even get into that. I want to give you guys a heads-up and let you know now that tonight I feel extra\\xa0comfortable. You’re going to notice that you might hear a little bit more Spanish than you normally would. And you can’t do that just anywhere, but you can do that in Houston. [cheering and applause] Now, to everyone watching at home who is freaking out, like, “Oh, my God! I didn’t sign up for this.” [laughter] If I say something in Spanish, my promise\\xa0is to translate immediately so that everyone enjoys the show. Okay? ‘Cause I know the second I said Spanish, people are freaking out, you know. All the people that drove in from the woodlands are like, “Hey!” [laughter] And for everyone at home, what does he mean by that, the people from the woodlands? You know. [laughter] [South Texas accent] “I know he is not referring to us.” [laughter] “The nerve of him!” “He needs to go back where he came from, over by Airline Road.” [laughter] [cheering] That’s right. I know where you keep your brown people. [laughter] This is awesome. This always pisses off Netflix. They’re like, “Gabriel, we really wish you would just do a show that’s general, that everybody understands. Why do you have to make your show so personal? Only people in that city are going to get it.” Well, when you have an arena full of people, you want them to get it. You want that extra personal special touch. I don’t care what they say. I already got the check. [laughter] Ha! So let me give you a heads-up as to what has happened since the last time I did a\\xa0special. Um, my son, Frankie, is now 19 years old. Nineteen years old, high school graduate, he has all his shots… Ladies? People tell me all the time. “Why do you talk about your son so much?” Because he won’t leave. [laughter] “Does he like it when you talk about him?” I said, “No, he hates it.” “Why do you do it?” “‘Cause he won’t leave.” [laughter] I’ll tell you what he likes to do right now. He likes to sit around the house and watch videos of other kids playing video games. See, some of you are clapping. I didn’t know that was an actual thing. I asked him, “What are you doing?” “I’m watching other kids playing video games.” I said, “That’s– Really? Why?” “Well, they’re professionals.” I’m like, “Why would you watch something that you could be doing?” “‘Cause they’re professionals.” “That’s dumb.” “Really, Dad? Every Sunday I see you watching football. [crowd ooh’s] How come you don’t play?” I don’t even argue. I just cut off the Internet. [laughter] My son’s problem right now is that he has, according to him, too many options. Okay? That’s his problem. I’m like, “Poor guy!” “I have so many options, Dad. I don’t know what to do.” Write them down. Put them on a wheel. Freaking– [mimics spinning wheel] Today: plumber. [laughter] Something! The problem is we go places, people find\\xa0out he is my son and then they offer him\\xa0opportunities. He doesn’t understand that that’s not how the real world works. I know about struggling and clawing, and fighting for the opportunity to do\\xa0something. He doesn’t get it yet. And that’s my fault. For example, I take him and his mom out to dinner, okay? I took them both to Red Lobster. Now, Houston. Me, personally, I love Red Lobster, okay? And not even for the seafood. I’m talking about the biscuits. [cheering] Oh, yeah. [vocalizes] It’s real good. [laughter] So we’re sitting there, and we’re having a\\xa0conversation with our son about life, opportunity, what does he want to do with himself… And as we’re talking to him, the manager from Red Lobster walks over to our table. And he’s being really cool, right? He’s like, “Hey!” And I’m like, “Hey!” He looks at my son, “Is this the\\xa0infamous Frankie?” And I say, “Why, yes, it is! He just graduated.” “Congratulations!” “And he’s looking for a job.” The manager goes, “Oh, say no more.” And he gives my son a business card and then he starts to say, “Listen, Frankie, this is all you have to do. Just go online and fill out the application. Once it’s registered, call me personally and I’ll see to it that you get an interview. The only position we have available right now is for a host, but there’s plenty of\\xa0room for opportunity here at Red Lobster. Besides, you got one hell of a reference.” And then he walked away and I was like, “Oh, my God. I’m going to get free biscuits!” [laughter] My son looks at me and says, “I don’t want to work at Red Lobster.” I said, “Frankie, no one is making you work anywhere. This is just another opportunity that you’re wasting. Okay. No Red Lobster. What’s your plan?” “I don’t know.” I got frustrated. So I raised my voice. “Well, you better start thinking.” His mom didn’t like that. “Don’t talk to him like that.” I said, “Look, biscuit blocker…” [laughter] See, up to this point we have agreed on how we raise our son. But in this situation, she’s trying to protect him from the world. I’m trying to prepare him for the world. If he cannot handle me raising my voice to get his attention to see the bigger picture, he’s not ready for a world that doesn’t care about his feelings. [crowd whooping, applauding] So I said, “You know what? I got to have a one-on-one with him. I got to have a one-on-one with, uh–” [evil laugh] So I take him out to the movies. I take him out to the movies, we get in the car, we take off. [mimics car engine] A little 20-minute drive, okay? As we’re driving I figure I’ll have a little one-on-one with him. Maybe this way it doesn’t feel like a talk talk. I thought he understood what I was trying to say. It’s late. We’re leaving the movies. We’re pulling out of the parking structure and out of the corner of my\\xa0eye, I see a cop car. And I made a sound, I was\\xa0like, “Ugh!” And Frankie goes, “What is it, Dad?” I say, “There’s a cop at the light.” “What are you worried about?” “He’s going to stop us.” “How do you know?” “Watch.” [laughter] I made that left turn… [mimics engine and siren chirping] Frankie’s losing it. “It’s happening!” I said, “Relax.” I pull over. [mimics tires screeching] Cop pulls up from behind. [mimics tires screeching] Immediately. [knock-knock] “Driver, windows down.” [groans] [mimics window whirring down] “Driver, hands out the window.” Serious? [laughter] “Both of them.” “I can’t, I’m fat!” [laughter] He gets to the window, and he’s got the\\xa0flashlight. And he shines the light right in my face. He’s like, “License.” “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.” He takes the license and then, of course, you know, “Do you know why I stopped you?” “Officer, no, I don’t, but I’m sure you’re about to tell me.” “You don’t have a front plate on your car.” I said, “Officer, you’re absolutely right. I do not have a front plate on my car, but my name is actually on the front of the car.” “Excuse me?” “My name is on the front of the car.” I own a 2012 Ford Flex and the Ford Flex has the\\xa0actual word “flex” written on the hood. I have a friend who does custom automotive work and he took all the\\xa0letters off the car except for the letter F, and he made letters so that it spells “Fluffy” on the hood. Okay? Yeah. -It sounds impressive. -[crowd whooping] You can do it too for like $23. It’s not that bad. They’re like refrigerator magnets. You can even move them. Like, one day a letter flew off and it said “Fuffy”. [laughter] Que pendejo. I know, stupid, right? So… The officer walks around to the front of the car and he takes his flashlight and he shines the light right on the hood, and he does this, he goes, “I knew it!” And my son goes, “What does that mean?” I said, “That means we get to go.” Oh, Houston, for the first time in a long time, my son was actually impressed by something that I did. You got to figure. This is not impressive to my son. Because he grew up in this environment. Okay, this does– You saw that, right? I saw like a– [laughter] That’s like the third one I’ve seen! This stuff keeps– [chuckles] People upstairs from Tomball, “Keep talking.” [laughter] Alright, I’ll tell you guys what happened. Shakira performed here a few days ago. And Shakira has an amazing show, okay? She doesn’t just come out and… [ululates] [humming “Whenever, Wherever” by Shakira] ♪ Together, together\\xa0♪ [indistinct] [crowd cheering] I think I just hurt myself. [laughter] But there’s a part of her show, where all of a sudden it was… [puffing] And there’s cannons with confetti that shoot everywhere, right? And I think that was left-over Shakira. [laughter] Can we edit out the part where I burned 800 calories? [laughter] [Fluffy laughs] Oh, my God! So, where was I? Oh! This. Does nothing for my son. and the reason\\xa0why I say that is because he grew up in this environment. He’s been to a thousand shows. He’s seen me on TV a million times. It’s not a big deal, but the fact that I\\xa0got stopped by a cop and the cop\\xa0recognized me and geeked out and let us go, I earned street cred with my kid! [laughter] Yeah, Frankie was like, “That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen!” And I’m like, “Hell, yeah, cos’. That’s right. You better recognize, player.” [laughter] [mimics engine turning over] We get home, he woke up his mom! “Mom, you should’ve seen it! We got stopped by the cops!” “Are you okay?” “Yeah! They recognized Dad and they let us go.” She stayed quiet and I told her, “Huh? I got recognized!” And she said, “Ah!” [laughter] So my son, what he likes to do now, like I said, Frankie likes to stay home and watch videos. I come downstairs one morning and he’s on his phone, but the chair that he’s sitting in is turned, facing the window, which I thought was weird. So I called to him, “Frankie, what are you doing?” Nothing. So he can’t hear– “Frankie!” He can’t hear. So I walked up from behind, and I realized that my son has little headphones. That’s– Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, he’s not ignoring me. So I look over his shoulder, and I realize that my son is watching a film. [crowd ooh’s] And I don’t mean Frozen. [laughter] But those people look cold. [laughter] So now I’m standing there watching it with him. I’m not trying to bond or anything. I’m just trying to figure out the conversation I need to have and now we’re both watching professionals. [laughter] So I grabbed his headphone and I went… “Hey, is that a good movie?” And he freaked out! [screams] And he threw the phone. The phone came partially undone and you could hear it. Oh, it was bad. “Not my face, not my face, not my face.” He turned bright red and he starts walking back over. “How embarrassing. How long have you been standing there?” I said, “Long enough to know ‘not my face.'” [laughter] “Are you going to tell my mom?” I said, “Frankie,\\xa0I love you way too much to do that to you. I would never tell your mom. I’mma tell everybody else.” [laughter] [laughs] Hey, don’t tell his mom. [laughter] I said, “Look, I know you’re not going to stop watching stuff like this. So just do me a favor. Don’t do this here. You’re old enough now to watch whatever you want to watch. But as long as you live in this house, you cannot be watching stuff like that where your mom can catch you. You’re not going to stop, so just don’t do it here.” “How do you know I’m not gonna stop?” “‘Cause I haven’t stopped. [laughter] Matter of fact, there’s a sequel to that. [laughter] It’s called Not my hair.” He said to me, “Que cochino!” I know right? [panting] I said, “Frankie, you’re going to watch stuff like that, just go in your room. Lock your door. I don’t want to catch you. Okay, so let me know.” “Want me to text you?” Never mind. [laughter] I’m in the middle of trying to deal with this whole situation with my son watching\\xa0these videos and not going to work, and while I’m doing this, I get the most\\xa0random phone call I’ve ever gotten. My publicist calls me up and she’s like, “Gabe! Snoop Dogg is looking for you.” -“Excuse me?” -“Snoop Dogg, you know–” “I know who Snoop Dogg is! What do you mean, he’s looking for me?” “Well, he’s looking–” “Is he looking for me or is he looking for me?” “He’s a fan and he wants to interview you.” “Oh, cool! Sounds good. What is it?” “I think it’s some type of podcast.” “I’m in. Can I bring Frankie?” “Absolutely.” “Cool.” So I hang up the phone. I’m excited. I want to tell my son. I’m like, “Frankie! I’m walking towards your room.” [laughter] I’ll be at your door in three, two, one. Hey! Alright, you’re dressed. Good. Come on, let’s go. “Where are we going?” “Watch.” We get in the car. [mimics engine] And now we’re off on this adventure to go do an interview with Snoop Dogg. You guys, let me tell you something. We get to the neighborhood and we’re lost. The GPS says we’re there, but we’re lost. We’re looking for a house, and there’s no house, just a big building. And so I’m like, “This doesn’t look– A podcast? Really?” So I pull up to the security gate. [mimics engine, tires screeching] Tap the button on the wall. [beep, line trilling] “Security desk. Can I help you?” Hey, Security Desk. My name is Gabriel Iglesias. I think I’m here to do an interview with Snoop Dogg. “Okay, one moment.” Oh, okay, this is it. Good, good. I’m so excited. Snoop Dogg! It’s gonna be cool, right? [laughter] “Sir?” “Yes?” “Yes, hi, there’s no Gilbert Ignazios on file.” What? “Could it be another name?” “Another name? I don’t know. Fluffy, maybe?” [beep] And the gate starts to open. [laughter] I’m like, “Oh, my God, I’m officially in the rappers’ world because my real name doesn’t mean shit!” [laughter] So we drive in. [mimics engine] And we’re passing all of these reserved parking spaces. Reserved, reserved, reserved, reserved. And we get to my space, which is basically an orange cone that has “Fluffy” handwritten on it. And a bunch of other names crossed off. [laughs] So Frankie moves the cone. I park the car. [vocalizes] We walk into the building. My publicist is waiting for me, right? She’s like, “Gabe! You made it. Frankie, how are you? Listen. I just finished talking to Snoop. [sighs] Wow. He is everything you think he is and just a little bit more. He is so sweet. I cannot believe he was charged with double murder.” [laughter] “He told me to just walk you guys into the studio and he’ll be right back. He said he had to go outside and get in the right headspace or something…” “Okay, cool.” So she walks us into Snoop’s studio. I’m thinking I’m there for a podcast, come to find out it’s for a TV show. Snoop has a TV show where he interviews celebrities. Everyone in the room is waiting for Snoop to return. You can hear the small talk. [indistinct babbling, giggling] [crowd laughs] All of a sudden, everyone stands up and I’m looking around like, “What’s going on?” And I look at the door to see if Snoop’s walking in and I don’t see him and I\\xa0could see my son. “Dad!” [muffled screaming] I don’t realize it, but Snoop is entering the room through a different door. I don’t realize it till, like, the last second. I’m like, “What do you–” So I jump up, I push in my chair. I’m so nervous, I don’t know how to address him. So I’m like… [laughter] I felt stupid. “Hi.” [laughter] Snoop walks over to me and he’s so\\xa0cool, you guys. He’s so cool. He walks over to me and he grabs my hand. He’s really strong. He pulls me in and he says, “Yo, what it do,\\xa0baby boo, how\\xa0you feel?” [laughter, applause] “Thank you for having me.” “Yeah.” -“Can I sit down?” -“For sure.” [mimics chair] I sit down, I look over, I see my son. My son’s like… [laughter] The difference between Snoop’s show versus any other talk show I’ve ever done is that usually there’s a person, like a producer\\xa0or a director who comes to you and gives\\xa0you information, like how the show begins, topics you’re going to cover, how you go to commercial, how you come back from commercial… I’ve spoken to no one. Snoop just starts talking and at some point, they hit “Record.” I’m waiting for “Action!” or a buzzer. [mimics buzzer] Something! Snoop just starts talking to me. “Yo, what up, big Fluff?” “Big Fluff? Oh, that’s– Hey!” [laughter] “Yo, you like music?” “Snoop, I love music. I love your music.” “Yeah, that’s what’s up.” He opens up a laptop computer and then he\\xa0hits “play.” And the next thing I know, we are listening to hardcore Mexican banda music. I mean hardcore. [vocalizing] And you can hear gunshots in the song. [laughter] [humming, mimics gunshots] [humming, mimics gunshots] [humming] And then a cow. [moos] [laughter] And the whole time Snoop is like, “I love\\xa0it when he go moo.” [laughter] What? I feel like he’s messing with me because I’m Mexican, right? So I called him out. I said, “Snoop. Do you understand what you’re listening to?” And he said this, and it’s scared me. He said, “Gangster recognize gangster.” [crowd ooh’s] The reason why it scared me was because he was telling the truth. We were listening to actual Mexican\\xa0cartel songs that don’t play on the radio. And the fact that he knew that, the fact that his level of street knowledge in another language was that on point, I said, “I gotta shut the hell up.” [laughter] Don’t speak unless spoken to. That’s the code. Next thing I know, Snoop reaches under the desk and he pulls out the biggest\\xa0blunt I have ever seen. [crowd gasps] Oh, this sucker was huge. As soon as he pulled out that freaking blunt, got excited because I wanted to grab my cell phone. Okay, I wanted to grab my cell phone so that I could take a selfie of Snoop in the\\xa0background being Snoop. So while I’m fumbling trying to get my phone, Snoop starts talking to me again. “Yo, Big Fluff?” Yeah, what? “Hit that while I hit this.” [laughter] The second I went like that, all of the\\xa0cameras in the room: red light. Red light.\\xa0Red light. Red light. Red light. My publicist is like, “No!” My son is like, “Yeah!” And now I’m being faced, bro. I’m being faced with a serious situation, because, you know, I’ve talked about friends participating and doing stuff like this, but I’ve never openly talked about myself… You know… And now I realized that from this moment forward, people are going to know what happened here with Snoop. So I started trying to find ways to justify it to myself. You know… If you’re going to do something like this on camera, you want it to be with Snoop. [laughter] You want it to be with Snoop, Cheech and Chong… [crowd cheering] …or Willie Nelson. [crowd cheering] Next thing I know, the manager hands me a lighter. I light it and I take a big hit. [sucking] So listen, I’m doing my best to hold in all this smoke, because I don’t want to look like a punk in front of Snoop Dogg. I’m trying, I’m fighting, bro. It’s hard, you know. [holding cough in] [laughter] The whole time Snoop is like, “Hell, yeah. That’s what I’m saying. Fluffy going puffy today.” [laughter] I do not remember the rest of the interview. What I remember is my buddy Anthony telling Snoop Dogg and I to stand up for a picture. “Stand up, get up for a picture.” And so Snoop and I both stand up to take this picture. I put my arm around him. I have to put my arm around him because he’s much taller than me, okay? Snoop has me by at least five inches. Shut up, alright? [laughs] [crowd cheering] You guys are laughing at the wrong jokes! [laughter] [Fluffy laughs] Bow-wow! [laughter] [low-pitched] Bow-wow. Everybody’s like, “This is a family show!” Well, apparently, that’s how families are made. That was too funny, sir. That was too funny. It’s sad how hard she laughed at that as she looked right at you. [laughter] I said, “Snoop has me by at least five inches,” and she’s like… [shrieks] Almost like she wasn’t even laughing at me. She was like laughing at you. So apparently you guys have some story that I just reignited. And now it’s awkward for all the kids. [laughter] So anyway… Snoop and I are taking photos, and then I\\xa0can hear my son. “Dad! Dad!” [gasps] “Oh! Um, Snoop, can my son take a photo with you?” “Yeah.” “Get over here!” And so Frankie runs up, you guys, and he’s so cute, because he’s geeking out really\\xa0hard. He’s like… [laughter] “Snoop, this is my son, Frankie. Frankie, say hello to Snoop.” And Snoop looks at me, and he’s so cool, Snoop is like… “Yo, this your kid? What up, Baby Fluff?” [laughter] And Frankie’s like… [laughter] “I don’t like that name.” “That’s too bad. Get a job, go. Go.” So Snoop and Frankie go into the corner to take pictures. Meanwhile, I walk back\\xa0over to the desk, because I want to grab\\xa0the sheet that has Snoop’s name and my\\xa0name on it. I want to have Snoop autograph it\\xa0so that I can frame it and put it on my wall. While I’m doing that, Frankie walks up from behind me and he whispers in my ear, trying to be all cool. “Dad! Dad!” “Huh? What? What?” “Dad, would it be okay if I finish smoking that with Snoop?” [laughter] Now I am being faced with the biggest moral decision of my life. And I’m high. And my mind is racing a thousand miles an hour. I’m like, “Should I let him, should I not? Am I a good dad, am I a bad dad? What’s his mom gonna think? I need a Snickers.” I’m just– And then I thought about it. “You know… Frankie, you’re over 18. Technically, you don’t have to ask me if you don’t want to, so as far as I’m–” [laughter] “Where’d you go?” A minute later, I am recording my son in a cloud with Snoop Dogg. [crowd cheering] And then I sent the video to his mom. [laughter] Hashtag biscuit blocker. Yes, I did. [laughter] Now, did this\\xa0actually happen? Yes, it did. You can go online and watch the video on YouTube. Punch in “Snoop Dogg”, next to that put “Fluffy” or “Gabriel” and you can see the\\xa0whole thing. Let me know how it turns out. [laughter] The fact that I got to meet Snoop was awesome. He looked for me. But every now and then, I go\\xa0out and I want to meet people, I want to see cool things. For example, comedy. I’m a huge fan of comedy. Not just performing it. But I love going to shows. I go to a comedy\\xa0show every now and then, alone. Now, I don’t know if that sounds weird to you guys, but for me to do anything nowadays by myself… It’s my crew. All the people that work for me, they freak out when I go places. They’re always concerned for my safety. “What if someone tries to kidnap you?” [laughter] Well, they’re going to earn it. [laughter] I got into a fight with some of my team members and I said, “You know what? I’m going out.” I bought myself a ticket and I went to go\\xa0watch Chris Rock, one night, in concert. [crowd cheering] Now, I says, “You know what? Maybe I can make my way backstage and, I don’t know, if I get lucky, maybe I’ll say hi to him. I’ve always wanted to meet him.” So I go to the side of the stage and I\\xa0run into security. And I said, “Hey!” He looked at me and said, “Fluffy!” When he did that, I said, “Hey, listen, I forgot my keys, I’ll be right back.” And the guy’s like, “Yeah, keep going, get your keys.” I’m like, “Oh, my God, that shit worked!” [laughter] Just like that, I snuck backstage at a Chris Rock concert. Once I was behind the curtain, I was in my element. I knew where everything was. I knew where the food was, I knew where the dressing rooms were, where the bathrooms were… I’m walking around with a soda, people are coming up to me. “We didn’t know you were going to be here.” “I got a call last minute.” [laughter] “Looking for my keys.” [laughter] I says, “You know what, I got this far. I’m going to push it. I want to meet him.” I’ve always wanted to meet Chris Rock. It was not hard. Once I was back there, I just had to go to the dressing rooms. All I had to do was read the name on the door. I’m standing there, in front of the door, and I’m hyperventilating. [panting] [mimics knocking] The door opens up and there’s this man in\\xa0there, this bodyguard who’s just massive. I’m a big guy, but damn, he was huge! As soon as he opened the door… [low-pitched growl] [mimics whooshing] [roaring] For real. Welcome to Jurassic– Big! Grandote. And I’m standing there and I’m like… “Hi.” And he’s like, “Can I help you?” “Yes, my name is Gabriel, I’m a comedian. And I wanted to see if I could say hi to Chris Rock if that’s possible.” “You say you comedian?” “Yes.” “Well, then you understand Chris is going over his material right now. He really ain’t trying to talk to nobody. So I’ll tell you what, player, if you want to come by after the show, You’re more than welcome to, but right now it’s not a good time. Chris Rock is a busy man.” [clicks tongue, sighs] [laughter] “Can I wave?” “Excuse me?” “Can I wave?” “What you mean?” “Can I wave to Chris? I don’t have to come in. Can I wave?” Chris Rock is in the room. He can hear the stupid conversation that’s taking place. [laughter] I know this because I can hear Chris Rock in the background. “What’s going on? Who’s at the door? Move out the way.” “Yo, Chris, I got this, man.\\xa0I got this.” “Move!” “Alright.” The guy stands to the side. And now I’m looking\\xa0at Chris Rock. And he recognized me. And it freaked me out. Oh, yeah, it freaked me out. He’s like, “Oh, shit! Look who it is.\\xa0Look who it is. It’s the king of the Mexicans.” [laughter] Chris Rock called me the king of the Mexicans. For the rest of the show, everyone referred to me as “El Chapo.” I was celebrating the fact that I got away with that for so long. For so long! “I snuck backstage at Chris Rock! I snuck backstage, I snuck–“ Until Karma\\xa0showed up one day, in the form of the most extreme fan I have ever had in 20 years of me being a comedian. I had someone who not only made it backstage. This person paid to get into my dressing room. Okay? Yeah. He didn’t pay me, by the way. He didn’t pay me. I’m an honest hoe. Okay? I made no money that day, alright? If I had gotten paid, you wouldn’t be hearing this story. Here’s the thing. I walk into my dressing room from the bathroom. I just finished showering up and I’m in a towel. I walk into the room, come to find out later that this man was a very wealthy businessman in the community, okay? And when I walked into the room, he’s wearing a very, very nice suit. So when I saw the suit, I didn’t give it\\xa0a second thought, because he looked professional. I thought maybe he was the general manager of the building, one of the\\xa0concert promoters, he could have been someone’s agent… So when I walked in the room, in my towel, right, “Can I help you?” He looks at me and it was the most uncomfortable conversation I have ever had. He looks at me and says, “Listen. [inhales deeply, exhales] [laughter] I am not here to waste any of your time. Fluffy, I am prepared to take care of you. I will give you a new Lexus. And an allowance that’s more than what you make as a comedian. Leave with me.” [laughter] I was never more disgusted and offended at the fact that I was not gay. [laughter] Because finally! Finally, somebody wants to take care of me. [cheering, applause] Do you know how many people I take care of? No one’s ever offered me a Lexus, and they should. I felt horrible saying no to this guy. I still think about it. [laughter] I still have the number. [laughter] Houston, I’m going to tell you something, and I don’t know how this is going to go over, but I’m going to say it. I would be an amazing gay partner. [laughter] I would! All the way up until that one part, but even then. [laughter] Have you ever driven a Lexus? [laughter] Those are nice! Sometimes you got to take one for your own team.\\xa0I’m just saying. [laughter] Now, in all seriousness, not to be funny, not to be disrespectful, let me tell you the reason why I would be an amazing gay partner. The level, the level of communication between two men is so high, I might actually get an answer. There might be clarity and understanding. I might hear a yes, I might hear a no. Do you know how many relationships I have been in where I still don’t know the outcome to certain conversations? [laughter] Very simple “yes or no” questions. That’s what I would do. Something as simple as… Bebé, you hungry? “Well… I haven’t eaten yet, so I probably should eat something, but I’m not feeling it right now. But if I don’t eat right now, you know how I’m gonna get later. So I guess it’s probably a good idea if I start eating right now, but it really\\xa0depends on the options. What do you think?” Ah! What about this one? Bebé, where would you like to eat? [laughter] You hear all the guys? “Finally! I’m not alone!” Everybody’s pointing at somebody right now. Guys, am I right? This has to be– You would think that this is the safest\\xa0question in the world to ask, but it’s not. “Well… Just pick something. You know me, I go with the flow. Whatever you decide is okay with me. You know me already, just pick something.” “Alright, we’re going to Burger King.” “I don’t like Burger King. Why do we got to go to Burger King? Burger King gives me chorro.” [laughter] Chorro is Mexican diarrhea. How about this one? “How do you feel?” “Really? Really? You want to know how I feel? Well, maybe if you’d pay attention from time to time, you might know how I feel. You might not\\xa0need to have to ask me such a question, because you would already know exactly how I feel. You might have time\\xa0and energy. I’m exhausted to let you know how I feel and you have the nerve to ask me ‘How do you feel?'” Now imagine the exact same conversation between me and Mr. Lexus. [laughter] Do you know how efficient that conversation would be? “Hey, bro! You hungry?” “I thought you’d never ask.” “What do you want to eat?” “Whatever you want to eat.” “We’re going to Burger King.” “I love Whoppers.” [laughter] “Me, too!” We go to Burger King and we tear it up. We get back home and I ask him, “Hey, how do you feel?” “Horny.” [laughter] “Me, too! How do you want to do this? Heads or\\xa0tails?” [laughter] It would be efficient! [applause] This is hypothetical. But believe me, I still think about it, you know? Especially whenever I get into fights with my girl and she says something like, “Oh, you think you can do better?” I know I can have a Lexus. [laughter] I don’t know, man. I know we’re in the middle of a Netflix taping. Whoever is running the light up there, just want to make sure, ’cause I keep moving. And I stepped out of your light twice. Any other show, I’d be like, “No problem, no big deal.” But this is for Netflix. It’s the people that replaced Comedy Central. [crowd ooh’s] But no, I’ll try not to move too fast, but how\\xa0slow are you if you can’t keep up with me? [laughter] You should work for Immigration. [laughter] I’m just giving you a hard time. I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Ladies and gen– I apologize for that. Can we give a big round of applause\\xa0to our person running the spotlight up there? [applause] I honestly don’t think that the people that work behind the scenes, like spotlight operators, get enough credit. Whether it’s spotlight operators, the people that run the cameras, the people\\xa0that set up the stages, the people that work security, the people that run the\\xa0building. Without them, there is no show. And the same thing goes with me. I got my own support team: managers, agents,\\xa0promoters, you know, freaking merchandise\\xa0people. I have a bus driver named Dave, who has never received any credit. And he’s\\xa0been working for me for almost 10 years now. This man… [cheering and applause] This man has\\xa0successfully gotten me to every single comedy show on time, without fail. [crowd cheering] If I had to describe him to you, okay? Dave looks like the word ‘Murica. [laughter] Not “America.” ‘Murica! He’s about six feet tall and he’s white. He has a gray beard and he wears a trucker hat. And he’s got to be one of the\\xa0most hardworking people I have ever met. When I say hardworking, Hey, I’m on the road 46 weeks out of the year. So I know. The difference is I fly home every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Dave stays on that bus and he gets it to the next city, where we meet him. He works anniversaries, holidays, special moments. Christmas time, I was with my family. Dave was driving that\\xa0bus on the East Coast. New Year’s, I was with my family. Dave was on the East\\xa0Coast driving that bus. One of the hardest working people I’ve ever met. I just want to give a shout-out. [applause, cheering] In addition to being hardworking, he’s, uh– He’s very honest. When I say honest, I don’t mean “Oh, he does his taxes right.” I mean painfully honest. No-filter honest. He talks the way people used to. He does not have time to mince words. He just calls it like he sees it. Before me, he used to work with a man by the name of Kenny G. Grammy Award winner, amazing, amazing music. Um… one day, Kenny G was on his tour bus that Dave was driving, and I guess the two of\\xa0them had a little discussion and Kenny G used some words\\xa0that Dave would’ve rather him not have used. And instead of getting into it with him, this is what Dave does. [mimics engine, tires screeching] [brake hissing, door whooshing] Kicked Kenny G off of his own bus. [laughter] Because he would rather lose his job than lose his self-respect. And that’s the man I work with. [cheering, applause] He’s a bad dude. You guys are clapping, but you should’ve seen the interview. Oh, man, it was a good one. [laughs] He looks at me and he says, “Hey! Let’s get one thing straight. I don’t give a shit who you are. You treat me right, I’ll treat you right. You pay me on time, you’ll live. [laughter] Not to mention the fact that he keeps that tour bus squeaky clean. And he takes a lot of pride in that as well. One night, I was drinking on the bus, and I go to put my cup down. And I miss the table, and the cup hit the floor. I didn’t get up right away to get the cup, because I figured I’ll get up in a\\xa0couple minutes and make myself another\\xa0drink, I’ll pick up the cup then. Dave sees the cup on the floor, and then he looks at me and says, “Hey! I ain’t your mama. Pick that shit up!” [laughter] I get to the back of the bus and I’m like, “Wait a minute, I pay him.” “Hey, Dave…” “Shut up!” “Yeah, I’ll be in the back, in my room. Thank you. Drive safe.” And people tell me, “You work with a man who talks that way to you? Why?” Let me tell you why. Because he’s honest. With Dave, you know exactly what you get. Nowadays, it’s so hard for me to tell who’s being genuine and who has an\\xa0agenda, and with him, you know exactly where you stand. If he likes you, he loves you. And if not,\\xa0you’re on the curb with Kenny G. [laughter] That being said, I have a story to share. [scattered whooping] About a year and a half ago, maybe longer, we’re on the bus and we’re heading down the highway. [mimics bus thrumming] Just so you have kind of an understanding of the bus layout. Let’s say this is the front. Here’s Dave, the driver. Empty seat. And then a sliding door that goes\\xa0in between him and the rest of the tour bus. My buddy\\xa0Alfred and I are in the living room portion and we’re watching TV. We’re watching the news, and on the news, there’s this person who is running for some type of office. No particular office. [laughter] And I guess their big plan is to erect a structure… [laughter] …between two bodies of land. [laughter] Somewhere. And I guess they want one side\\xa0of the structure to finance the entire project. Well, my buddy Alfred and I have a lot of family that works in construction and we know a bad job when we see one. So we started to voice our opinion out loud about how we felt about this person and what they wanted to do. We’re being very loud. So loud, Dave can hear us and then we hear Dave. [exaggerated laugh] “‘Murica.” [laughter] I yell out to Dave, I say, “Be quiet, Dave. This isn’t about you.” He taps a button on the dashboard that activates the sliding door. And when the door is about that far from closing, he yells out, “I’m building a wall.” [thud] [laughter] I couldn’t even get upset because I was\\xa0too much in shock over the fact that that came out of someone four feet away from me. My buddy Alfred and I, we looked like chickens. We’re like… [clucking noises] My cell phone goes off. [mimics phone vibrating] I take out my phone and there’s a text message. From Dave. [laughter] And I said, “That’s right. He better say, ‘I’m sorry.’ He better say, ‘Just kidding.'” I open up the text message and it says, “And you’re paying for it.” [laughter, applause] And people tell me, “You still work with\\xa0him after that?” Yes, I do. I trust that man with my life every single night. I know where his heart’s at. He can say whatever he wants. At the end\\xa0of the day,\\xa0he still has to drive around the king of the Mexicans. [laughter] [whooping, applause] The point to this story is just because you have a difference in opinion, it doesn’t mean that you can’t have respect for one another, you can’t have love for one another, that you can’t have incredible\\xa0friendships with one another. It’s our differences that make us\\xa0special. What a lot of us need to work on is our delivery. It’s all in the way you say things. That’s why text messages are always misinterpreted. ‘Cause you read the text according to how you feel. “What does he mean, ‘Hello’?” Yeah. Anyway, Dave has gotten us to 48 of the 50\\xa0states. He doesn’t travel with us outside of America. He prefers it that way. Last year, we got a chance to do a European tour\\xa0of 15 countries. Estonia, Germany, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, UK…\\xa0We’re just bouncing around all over the place. And then we wound up on the other side of the world.\\nOut of all the countries I performed in, my favorite country outside of home is Australia. And I’ll tell you why. Australia, much like us in America, has its list of priorities. You know what’s not on their\\xa0list? Political correctness. They do not care about your feelings. It’s like a country full of Daves. [laughter] Believe it or not, it’s very refreshing to be around such a large group of people who speak their minds so freely. And if you know that\\xa0before you go there, you’re going to have an amazing time, but if you don’t know\\xa0that and you show up, it is a culture\\xa0shock and a half, because I showed up and\\xa0I didn’t know. Everybody says you got to see the beaches and I went to the beach. I had people coming up to me. “Hey! Somebody help me get him back in the water.” [laughter] “Yeah, right there, big fella. Look at you, right there. Oh, wait, he’s moving. He’s moving, he’s moving. Oh, he’s crying! He’s crying! I bet it tastes like gravy.” [laughter] It’s not bullying if everyone does it. Yeah, that being said, I’m in Australia. Sydney, Australia, at the Opera House, for me, was one of the most iconic places I’ve ever got to perform in and it was bucket\\xa0list, definitely. After the show, I want to go hang out with some Aussies see what that was like. I’m hanging out at a pub. First things first. Australian people do not drink Foster’s beer. That’s an American thing. They don’t drink\\xa0that over there. I tried ordering one to fit in, didn’t go over well. Bartender looked at me, “You like the taste of piss, do ya?” [laughter] “Okay, don’t order that again.” So I’m hanging out with these two Aussies and we’re drinking a rum called Bundaberg. At first glance, it looks like a Coca-Cola bottle because there’s a polar bear on the front and then you drink it and you’re like, “That’s not Coke.” [laughter] As we’re talking, a third Australian joined the conversation, and he sounded a little bit different from the other two. He had more of a raspy voice. More like… [growls indistinctly] He sounded like a drunk pirate underwater. [laughter] These two guys didn’t like him, so they called him a name and they left, and now\\xa0it’s just me and drunk pirate. We’re talking about life. Life in America, life in Australia, talking about our differences. He tells me that he’s a professional knife maker. He’s showing me how it’s done, he’s showing me pictures. We wind up polishing off three bottles of this rum. And drunk wasn’t even the right word to describe our level. My tour manager Ryan, he comes up to me\\xa0and he says, “Gabe, time to go.” And I look at\\xa0Ryan and I’m like, “But Ryan, I just made a friend and he makes knives and they’re pretty.” My tour manager always knows how to talk to me no matter what condition I’m in. If I’m drunk, he knows better than to talk to me like I’m an adult. He talks to me like I’m two. He looks at me and he says, “Hey, buddy. [laughter] You hungry? [laughter] Well, listen, if we don’t leave right now, they’re gonna close McDonald’s and you’re going to have to eat at the airport.” I gotta go. “Alright, mate, you gotta go, you gotta go. No worries.” And he goes to shake my hand. And when he shook my hand, he put his personal\\xa0pocket knife that he made in my hand as a gift. “That’s for you, mate. Thanks for being nice.” “Thank you! Thank you! I’ll cut cheeseburgers with this.” [laughter] We leave, and we head to the restaurant. [mimics engine] The manager at the restaurant recognized me. He’s a big fan. And he said, “Hey, stay as\\xa0long as you like.” Shouldn’t have said that. The plan was do the show, go have some drinks, get a bite to eat, go to the hotel, shower up and then go to the airport. We stayed so long at the restaurant, we had to go straight to the airport. So we get there, and you don’t\\xa0sober up in like two hours, after three bottles of rum. I was not in airport condition. [laughter] And so my tour manager has one hand on each shoulder, right? Ryan’s trying to push me through the airport, and, you know, he’s about 190. I’m not. [laughter] And he’s pushing me with everything. [laughter] And he gets me all the way to airport security. And airport security in Australia, you don’t have to take off your shoes, and I didn’t worry about taking off a belt because I don’t wear a belt, ’cause I have a butt. So he lines me up with airport security and he tells me, “I got to let you go.” “Don’t let me go.” “I got to let you go.” “Don’t let me go!” And then he pushed me, and I’m going forward. And he yells out, “You’re a plane!” and the two-year-old came out. “I’m a plane!” [laughter, applause] And now this Fluffy\\xa0747 is headed right for the metal detector, and I can see the security officer on the other side. [laughter] And when I got really close, Ryan yells out, “Wings down!\\xa0Wings down!” And I went through and I didn’t touch the edges, but when I went through… [beep] -[man in the crowd] The knife. -[crowd gasps] I sobered up for half a second because I realized, Oh, my God, I forgot to check the knife that the guy gave me and it’s on me\\xa0and I’ve already cleared the freaking… You\\xa0know… So I’m like… The security officer does this. “Eh, go ahead.” [laughter] Houston, sober me would have internally celebrated the fact that I am not going\\xa0to prison for sneaking a knife past airport security and boarding a flight. Drunk me was offended. [laughter] Oh, you can ask my buddy, Ryan was right behind me. I looked at the security officer and I said, “Hey! Hey! How do you know? How do you know I’m not a terrorist?” And I can hear my friends in line. “Fuck!” [laughter] The security officer in uniform, wearing a badge, looks at me and says, “Hey, when have you ever seen a fat terrorist?” [laughter] “Eh, look at him. He’s crying. I bet it tastes like gravy.” [laughter] Yeah. -You guys, I gotta tell you– -[man] We love you, Fluffy! What happened, bro? [man] We love you! Do you have a Lexus? [laughter] ‘Cause I’m not passing that up again. [laughter] [laughing] Sorry. I just– But thank you. [laughing] Actually, I’ve had some pretty awesome times over the last 20 years. And whenever I talk to fans, they have\\xa0certain questions about my past, whether it’s my family, my upbringing, where my mom came from, where my dad came from… Certain stories. I love the fact that I had someone ask me one time, “In your 20-plus years as a comedian, what has been your greatest moment?” My greatest moment wasn’t even something that happened at a show, but it was\\xa0because of what I was able to do for someone very special to me. My mom, who is no longer with us, she meant everything to me. She was my biggest supporter, even though she would never laugh at my jokes. She would get mad at her friends that wouldn’t laugh. -“¿Pendejo, por que no te ríes?” -[laughter] How come you don’t laugh? I did something really awesome for my mom before she passed away. I took her to go see a man by the name of Vicente Fernandez. [crowd cheering] In concert. now if you’re not familiar with who Vicente Fernandez is, he is basically Mexican Elvis. But he’s still alive. [laughter] So a few years ago, Vicente Fernandez and myself were both performing at the same venue, a venue called\\xa0the Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. It is no longer there. A woman by the name of Emily was running the building. I was there the week before Vicente Fernandez, and after three sold-out shows she comes up to me and says, “Gabriel, thank you so much for this incredible business. We’re so happy with how the shows turned out. I have a question for you. Is your mom a fan of Vicente Fernandez?” I said, “Emily, my mom’s Mexican. [laughter] It’s the law.” [laughter] “I thought so. Listen, Vicente Fernandez is going to be performing here next week. And I wanted to do something very special for you to show my appreciation. Do you think you and your mom would like to come see him perform and I’ll get you\\xa0front-row center?” I said, “Emily, that sounds amazing. I’m pretty sure the answer is yes, but my mom is old school, so I still got to ask. I’ll call you.” So I get to my mom’s house, and I see her. “Mama.” “Dime, mi hijo.” Mi hijo in Spanish means “my son.” So my mom would always tell me that, my son, mi hijo. Mi hijo. “Dime, mi hijo.” “Tell me, my son.” I said, “Mom, would you like to go see Vicente Fernandez in concert?” And she looked at me and said, “Mi hijo, that sounds nice.” That’s exactly how she said it. She was very even-keeled. She wouldn’t show a lot of emotion. So I call Emily and I said my mom’s in. “Awesome. I’ll see you next week.” So we get to the venue and we’re early, so they have us in this little VIP section where they’re giving us free drinks and free snacks, and my mom was so cute. She walks up to me and she says, “Mi hijo, are the drinks free?” I said, “Mom, yeah, the drinks are free, but don’t worry about it.” “No, no, no, mi hijo,\\xa0I didn’t bring any money. I don’t have no money.” I said, “Mom, you made an ATM. You’re good.” [laughter] [cheering, applause] The messed up part is that she didn’t even like drinking. She just wanted to walk around with a couple of drinks so she’d look like she was part of the party. -[laughter] -You know? So she’s got a couple drinks, and as it was, when she’d walk around, she’d have a little bit of a limp, because she had just had toe surgery a couple months prior. So she had kind of like a little– It looked like she was dancing. [vocalizing] So she’s walking around. Here comes Emily. “Gabriel, you made it!” I go, “Yeah, this is my mom. Emily, this is my mom, Esther. Mom, this is Emily.” “They’re free!” “She knows they’re free. She made this happen.” “Oh, thank you, thank you! You’re the one who hired mi hijo. Gracias. Thank you so much.” Emily goes, “Can I talk to you for a second?” “Sure. Mom, I’ll be right back. What’s up, Emily?” “Gabriel, do you think your mom would you like to meet Vicente Fernandez right now?” I said, “Emily, let me tell you something… [laughter] …if she says no, I want to meet him. [laughter] I’ll be right back.” “Mamá.” “Dime, mi hijo”. Emily wants to know if you would like to meet Vicente Fernandez right now. “Mi hijo, that sounds nice.” “Alright. Emily, she’s in.” Emily goes, “Is she even a fan?” I go, “Trust me, that’s her reaction. She’s good. She has the whole house\\xa0covered with Vicente Fernandez records and cassettes. Okay? We’re good.” So Emily comes back. And she puts the special VIP bracelets on us with a little click, and she walks us through a door into the backstage area. As soon as we went through the door, I knew exactly where we were. I was just there a week ago. So I got my mom arm in arm, and we’re walking down the hallway, okay? Come on, Mama. Let’s go. Let’s go. We’re walking down the hallway, and we’re getting closer and closer to Vicente Fernandez’s dressing room. The door is wide open, and I can hear a\\xa0commotion coming out of the dressing room. [shrieking] And then a man and a woman exit the room and the man is holding on to the woman’s shoulders and he’s like, “It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s okay, it’s okay.” And the woman looks destroyed. Okay? [wailing] Mascara is running down her face. My mom sees that and she’s like, “Mi hijo, did you see that? Did you see the mascara… [shrieks] With the mascara– Parece puta la cabrona.” [laughter] Sorry. Puta means “friendly.” [laughter] So we get by the door, and the closer we get, we start to see a\\xa0guy in the room. Then he comes to the door. In the room, there’s three people, okay? There’s Vicente Fernandez, the photographer and a handler. The handler comes to the door, and you can tell by his voice that he works for like a Mexican radio station, ’cause he’s got that voice. “Hola! Hola! Pasale! Pasale!” Pasale in Spanish means “come on in.” So we start to walk into the room. And let me tell you guys something, If you grew up listening to Vicente Fernandez from a young age, and you get\\xa0the opportunity to meet him, it is seriously a religious experience. My mom and I are entering the room, the only thing missing is the freaking… [imitates cleric speaking Latin] [laughter] You don’t look at him. You look at the floor. Out of respect, you just look at the floor. “Come on, Ma”. We get all the way up to him and I see boots. And when I see the boots, my mom and I both just… [laughter] He knows what you’re doing. He knows you’re checking him out. So what he does is he poses, okay? Vicente stands there and he poses. He’ll have the sombrero, the hat, to his side. And then, he doesn’t look at you. He looks away. [laughter] And he sticks his chest out and he stands\\xa0there looking like a big-ass bottle of Tapatio at Costco. [laughter] [applause] And then he looked at me. [mimics whooshing] And he recognized me. not as a comedian, but because I was there the week before and my photo was hanging outside his door. It was whoever is there last, they always rotate the photo. So he sees me and\\xa0he’s like, “Mi hijo, tu eres el muchacho que esta en la foto ahí afuera.” “Yeah, that’s me outside, yeah. Hola!” [laughter] “Oh. Vicente, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Le presento… mi mamá!” [laughter] I’m like, “Oh, my God. I think I just offered up my mom to Vicente Fernandez.” [laughter] She’s like 73. “Better late than never, Mom, get him!” My mom starts walking up to, Vicente. He was so nice. He goes out to shake my mom’s hand and my\\xa0mom grabs his hand. And I don’t know where she got this strength and energy from, but\\xa0she grabbed him and pulled him in. Hard, like the video game. “Get over here!” And then hooked him. She hooked him and she starts screaming into his chest. “Mi Chente!” I’m like, “Oh, my God. She’s getting horny.” [laughter] And he knew, too! ‘Cause he was like, “Quitamela! Quitamela!” The photographer, the handler and me. The three of us is what it took to pull her off of Vicente. We sit her down, she’s bawling. [wailing] Mascara is running down her face. [laughter] The photographer shaking his head. I guess Vicente had dinner earlier that night. He was eating barbecue, ’cause they had those wet naps. Barbecue wet naps. And so we take the wet naps and we start\\xa0cleaning the mascara off my mom’s face. We stand her up. We posed her and we took the picture. Emily comes over and she takes us and she escorts us to our seats in the front. And for three hours… for three hours, my mom was on her feet listening to him and she refused to sit down. “Mom, you should sit down–” “No, ¿cómo qué? És el Chente.” Holding a shot of tequila that she never drank. [laughter] She just– She was– [laughter] Three hours on her feet. Never once sat down. That’s how powerful his music was. [applause] My mom felt no pain for that entire time. And the minute that freaking concert was over, “Tan-taran, tan-tan.” “My feet! Oh, my God, mi hijo, mis pies. Ay, pinche callo. “Oh, my God, my feet! Ay!” And I’m like, “Oh, great.” So now I gotta drag this living novela to the parking lot. I helped her into the car. “My feet!” “I told you to sit down.” “You don’t sit for Chente.” Here comes Emily. “Did you guys have a good time?” I go, “Emily, we had the greatest time. Thank you so much.” “I got something for you.” Oh, what’s that? And she hands me an envelope and I open it, and inside the envelope is the picture. She printed it out for me, and when I\\xa0looked at it I got so choked up because I have never seen my mom so happy in a picture. And it’s not that she wouldn’t smile. She would smile, but it was that “one, two, three, cheese.” [laughter] But this one was like… [laughter] And what makes it extra special is that it’s the last photo I have of my mom and she was the happiest. And I know that that\\xa0moment wouldn’t be possible if I did not do this for a living. [applause] So thank you for that. Sorry, now a lot of people are like, “We came to laugh…” -[mumbling indistinctly in Spanish] -[laughter] Houston, I got to share this story. Twenty years ago, when I started doing this, okay, the fact that we’re here tonight in an arena doing a comedy special is huge, but everything… Everything has a beginning. The fact that I can travel and I meet so many people, “we are your fans,”\\xa0“we are your fans,” and social media shows over 10 million, everything comes from somewhere. And the fact that tonight I have in the audience my first two fans that ever came out to see one of my shows, I flew them out from Los Angeles to be here tonight. [cheering and applause] Monica, Tony, where you guys at? There you are. Ladies and gentlemen… [crowd cheering] …Monica and Tony Sanchez. When I say they were my first fans, they were my first, they would come out… I used to perform in her garage. And she’ll tell you. Oh, yeah. Right next to the Ford. [laughter] They were the first ones. They were the\\xa0first ones to come see me perform at a\\xa0little dive– hole-in-the-wall inside of a casino in California. And, um… You know, to have met these people so many years ago and they’d come out, she would tell me with her husband,\\xa0“You were so funny, we’ll be back next week.” I’m like, “But it’s the same 5-minute show.” She goes, “You’re funny, we’ll bring more people. We’ll bring more people. She was my first fan club. She would get friends and bring them out to the show. [applause] And she has pictures of me in that garage. I wish you wouldn’t put them online, but you do. [laughter] But I just wanted to say thank you, guys, and I’m glad you could be here tonight. Twenty years doing this, so I think it’s only right that tonight we close this show the way that the first one began. [cheering, applause] I get pulled over one night two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-thru. You better still laugh, Houston! I made a left turn instead of making a right turn but I wasn’t paying attention ’cause I had a box, right? I was like, “You’re going to\\xa0get it when you get home, you’ve been so bad! So bad! [screams] Gonna get it!” I’m not paying attention, I go the wrong way. [mimics car turning] Sure enough… [mimics siren chirping] Oh! [tires screech] Later. [mumbling] The officer is taking forever. I said, “Forget this, he’s taking too long.” I grab my box, I put it on my lap. I flipped it open. Hmm! [laughs] Hmm… [shrieks] And just as I was about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window. “You know why I stopped you?” It was too easy. -I said, “‘Cause you could smell it!” -[crowd] …could smell it! [cheering and applause] Keep going! [crowd exclaims] -Houston, keep going! -[crowd] Yeah! I should have started the show like this, okay? Um, I bought a Volkswagen Beetle about seven years ago. [crowd cheering] And when you buy a new car, you want to show it off, whether it’s brand new or just new to you. So I take my car to my friend Martin’s house. You’ve seen Martin. Very real. I pull up. [mimics tires screeching] I yell out the window, -Mar– -[crowd, in unison] Martin! [cheering, applause] [whooping] You don’t need me anymore. [laughter] That’s freaking awesome! Thank you. Love you, too. Hold on, hold on. I forgot the joke. Hold on. [laughter] I know how it starts and I know how it ends. I’m just not used\\xa0to starting from the middle. [laughter] That’s what she said. No, just– [laughter] Stop. You deserve better than that. Um… Martin… lives in a bad neighborhood. I don’t get out of the car. Across the\\xa0street from his house live these gang members, the kind of gang members who don’t really hurt anybody. They just talk a lot of trash and watch Frozen. [laughter] And I pull up in a Beetle. [mimics tires screeching] [all in unison] Martin! Across the street, I hear… [all in unison] Órale! [cheering and applause] Let me finish! [laughter] -Someone said, “That’s what she said.” -[laughter] [Fluffy laughs] Hey, hey. [clicks tongue] Ah! I turn around. “Hey, what’s up, you guys? How’s it going?” “How did you get in there, ese?” “Hurry up, Martin!” A couple of months go by. I fix up the car. I put racing rims on it, some stickers. I put little chip in the motor to make it go faster. Two hundred and fifty horsepower Volkswagen Beetle. The car is bad. I pull up. [mimics driving, tires screeching] [engine revving] -[horn honking] -[laughter] [all in unison] Martin! [all in unison] Órale! Some of you are drunk. [laughter] This is what I just heard. I heard… “Órale!” “Le!” Keep up! I know it’s Mexicans too. I hear the accent. I hear that– [mumbles indistinctly mocking Mexican accent] Even the white people are like, “Hello! It’s odalay.” [laughter] “Get it together.” Keep up! -Eh. -[crowd] Eh. [all in unison] Eh. [all in unison] Yoo-hoo! “What?” [all in unison] “Check it out, eh, it’s the Fat and the Furious!” I heard you, Houston! [cheering and applause] I heard you. You guys were saying the joke with me like it was a song. Like it was the Mexican version of Freebird. [laughter] Keep going! [crowd roars] Keep going! [crowd roars] Chills. My son Frankie, when he graduated from high school, I was very, very proud of him and I was very excited. And, uh… For me, it was very emotional, because I was the one that got to take him to school on that last day, and it meant a lot, because you know what? [laughs] I was allowed to leave him anywhere I wanted to. I can leave him in the front. I can leave him on the side. I can put him in the back. I can make him walk. That wasn’t the case many years ago, when I was taking him to elementary school. And they had a designated drop-off area on the side of the school, where they had\\xa0cones in the middle of the street. They had a supervisor there with a walkie-talkie and a whistle to make sure\\xa0that your kids would get out of the car safely and onto the school grounds. One day we’re late because the night before I had a big show like this one. And people brought me chocolate cakes. And I took the cakes home and my son killed one of the cakes. And the next day,\\xa0the cake… [mimics stomach rumbling] …killed Frankie. [laughter] Oh, it was bad. [mimics high-pitched fart] Chorro! Chocomilk! For the non-Mexicans:\\xa0Yoo-hoo! [laughter] For the non-Mexicans with money: Nestle Quik! [laughter] Same joke. We get to the school. There’s no longer supervisor, no walkie-talkie, no whistle, the gate’s locked. I said, “I’m not leaving my kid here.” I’m going to drop him off in front. And I\\xa0guess I wasn’t supposed to do that and I didn’t know, and at the time, I didn’t really care. We pull up. [mimics car driving, tires screeching] “Go.” “I’m not supposed to get off here.” “You’re late. Go.” [groans] And he cracks the door. And as soon as his foot hits the curb, here comes the principal. And I know who it is, ’cause he’s freaking out, right? He’s like… [whispering] “It’s the principal!” “Dude, relax. I’m 32, I don’t give a damn!” [laughter] Here comes the principal and she’s doing this one. [high-pitched voice] “Sir! Sir! Sir, this is not the designated drop-off area. Please take your child to the other side of the school. You cannot leave him here.” I was like, “Watch this.” Señora, no sé lo que esta diciendo. Aqui estoy dejando a mi hijo. El no se levantó a la mañana. It’s not my fault. Yo no sé. “That’s how you do it, homeboy. That’s how you do it.” That principal was awesome because she was like, [American accent] Usted no puede dejar su hijo aqui. Okay? [American accent] Saca la vuelta al otro lado de la escuela. Okay? [all in unison] Allá, si, si. Aqui, no, no. [all in unison] Allá, si, si. Aqui, no, no. [all in unison] Yo no soy pendeja! [laughter, applause] Monica, Tony. Twenty years ago, when I was in your garage, if you would’ve told me this was going to happen I’d have said you’re crazy. If you would have told me, “Twenty years from now people are going to come out and fill up arenas to see you. They’re going to cheer for you, and they’re going to finish your jokes… in Houston, Texas.” [crowd cheering, applauding] This special is dedicated to both of you and to this city. That’s Houston strong. Thank you very much, and you have a great night! And I hope I keep making you proud. Thank you. [cheering, applause]\""

macho man  i’ve got to be a macho  how are you   whoo oh man that’s a long walk  thank you so much houston  one year ago this city was flipped upside down by a hurricane un cabrón named harvey  and they said that this city would never be the same i think it’s beautiful that a year later we’re all here celebrating together the fact that this city is resilient and you guys persevered houston’s strong baby  that’s serious in all sincerity guys i’m not trying to kiss your ass i already got your money  freaking houston i love this town i’ve been coming here for  years twenty years started off performing at a comedy club called the last stop  and then of course we jumped over to the improv and then– i performed everywhere i even did a onenighter in tomball  that’s a long story for the people at home i won’t even get into that i want to give you guys a headsup and let you know now that tonight i feel extracomfortable you’re going to notice that you might hear a little bit more spanish than you normally would and you can’t do that just anywhere but you can do that in houston  now to everyone watching at home who is freaking out like oh my god i didn’t sign up for this  if i say something in spanish my promiseis to translate immediately so that everyone enjoys the show okay ‘cause i know the second i said spanish people are freaking out you know all the people that drove in from the woodlands are like hey  and for everyone at home what does he mean by that the people from the woodlands you know   i know he is not referring to us  the nerve of him he needs to go back where he came from over by airline road   that’s right i know where you keep your brown people  this is awesome this always pisses off netflix they’re like gabriel we really wish you would just do a show that’s general that everybody understands why do you have to make your show so personal only people in that city are going to get it well when you have an arena full of people you want them to get it you want that extra personal special touch i don’t care what they say i already got the check  ha so let me give you a headsup as to what has happened since the last time i did aspecial um my son frankie is now  years old nineteen years old high school graduate he has all his shots… ladies people tell me all the time why do you talk about your son so much because he won’t leave  does he like it when you talk about him i said no he hates it why do you do it ‘cause he won’t leave  i’ll tell you what he likes to do right now he likes to sit around the house and watch videos of other kids playing video games see some of you are clapping i didn’t know that was an actual thing i asked him what are you doing i’m watching other kids playing video games i said that’s– really why well they’re professionals i’m like why would you watch something that you could be doing ‘cause they’re professionals that’s dumb really dad every sunday i see you watching football  how come you don’t play i don’t even argue i just cut off the internet  my son’s problem right now is that he has according to him too many options okay that’s his problem i’m like poor guy i have so many options dad i don’t know what to do write them down put them on a wheel freaking–  today plumber  something the problem is we go places people findout he is my son and then they offer himopportunities he doesn’t understand that that’s not how the real world works i know about struggling and clawing and fighting for the opportunity to dosomething he doesn’t get it yet and that’s my fault for example i take him and his mom out to dinner okay i took them both to red lobster now houston me personally i love red lobster okay and not even for the seafood i’m talking about the biscuits  oh yeah  it’s real good  so we’re sitting there and we’re having aconversation with our son about life opportunity what does he want to do with himself… and as we’re talking to him the manager from red lobster walks over to our table and he’s being really cool right he’s like hey and i’m like hey he looks at my son is this theinfamous frankie and i say why yes it is he just graduated congratulations and he’s looking for a job the manager goes oh say no more and he gives my son a business card and then he starts to say listen frankie this is all you have to do just go online and fill out the application once it’s registered call me personally and i’ll see to it that you get an interview the only position we have available right now is for a host but there’s plenty ofroom for opportunity here at red lobster besides you got one hell of a reference and then he walked away and i was like oh my god i’m going to get free biscuits  my son looks at me and says i don’t want to work at red lobster i said frankie no one is making you work anywhere this is just another opportunity that you’re wasting okay no red lobster what’s your plan i don’t know i got frustrated so i raised my voice well you better start thinking his mom didn’t like that don’t talk to him like that i said look biscuit blocker…  see up to this point we have agreed on how we raise our son but in this situation she’s trying to protect him from the world i’m trying to prepare him for the world if he cannot handle me raising my voice to get his attention to see the bigger picture he’s not ready for a world that doesn’t care about his feelings  so i said you know what i got to have a oneonone with him i got to have a oneonone with uh–  so i take him out to the movies i take him out to the movies we get in the car we take off  a little  drive okay as we’re driving i figure i’ll have a little oneonone with him maybe this way it doesn’t feel like a talk talk i thought he understood what i was trying to say it’s late we’re leaving the movies we’re pulling out of the parking structure and out of the corner of myeye i see a cop car and i made a sound i waslike ugh and frankie goes what is it dad i say there’s a cop at the light what are you worried about he’s going to stop us how do you know watch  i made that left turn…  frankie’s losing it it’s happening i said relax i pull over  cop pulls up from behind  immediately  driver windows down   driver hands out the window serious  both of them i can’t i’m fat  he gets to the window and he’s got theflashlight and he shines the light right in my face he’s like license yeah yeah yeah yeah here he takes the license and then of course you know do you know why i stopped you officer no i don’t but i’m sure you’re about to tell me you don’t have a front plate on your car i said officer you’re absolutely right i do not have a front plate on my car but my name is actually on the front of the car excuse me my name is on the front of the car i own a  ford flex and the ford flex has theactual word flex written on the hood i have a friend who does custom automotive work and he took all theletters off the car except for the letter f and he made letters so that it spells fluffy on the hood okay yeah it sounds impressive  you can do it too for like  it’s not that bad they’re like refrigerator magnets you can even move them like one day a letter flew off and it said fuffy  que pendejo i know stupid right so… the officer walks around to the front of the car and he takes his flashlight and he shines the light right on the hood and he does this he goes i knew it and my son goes what does that mean i said that means we get to go oh houston for the first time in a long time my son was actually impressed by something that i did you got to figure this is not impressive to my son because he grew up in this environment okay this does– you saw that right i saw like a–  that’s like the third one i’ve seen this stuff keeps–  people upstairs from tomball keep talking  alright i’ll tell you guys what happened shakira performed here a few days ago and shakira has an amazing show okay she doesn’t just come out and…    together together   i think i just hurt myself  but there’s a part of her show where all of a sudden it was…  and there’s cannons with confetti that shoot everywhere right and i think that was leftover shakira  can we edit out the part where i burned  calories   oh my god so where was i oh this does nothing for my son and the reasonwhy i say that is because he grew up in this environment he’s been to a thousand shows he’s seen me on tv a million times it’s not a big deal but the fact that igot stopped by a cop and the coprecognized me and geeked out and let us go i earned street cred with my kid  yeah frankie was like that’s the coolest thing i’ve ever seen and i’m like hell yeah cos’ that’s right you better recognize player   we get home he woke up his mom mom you should’ve seen it we got stopped by the cops are you okay yeah they recognized dad and they let us go she stayed quiet and i told her huh i got recognized and she said ah  so my son what he likes to do now like i said frankie likes to stay home and watch videos i come downstairs one morning and he’s on his phone but the chair that he’s sitting in is turned facing the window which i thought was weird so i called to him frankie what are you doing nothing so he can’t hear– frankie he can’t hear so i walked up from behind and i realized that my son has little headphones that’s– oh okay okay yeah he’s not ignoring me so i look over his shoulder and i realize that my son is watching a film  and i don’t mean frozen  but those people look cold  so now i’m standing there watching it with him i’m not trying to bond or anything i’m just trying to figure out the conversation i need to have and now we’re both watching professionals  so i grabbed his headphone and i went… hey is that a good movie and he freaked out  and he threw the phone the phone came partially undone and you could hear it oh it was bad not my face not my face not my face he turned bright red and he starts walking back over how embarrassing how long have you been standing there i said long enough to know ‘not my face  are you going to tell my mom i said frankiei love you way too much to do that to you i would never tell your mom i’mma tell everybody else   hey don’t tell his mom  i said look i know you’re not going to stop watching stuff like this so just do me a favor don’t do this here you’re old enough now to watch whatever you want to watch but as long as you live in this house you cannot be watching stuff like that where your mom can catch you you’re not going to stop so just don’t do it here how do you know i’m not gonna stop ‘cause i haven’t stopped  matter of fact there’s a sequel to that  it’s called not my hair he said to me que cochino i know right  i said frankie you’re going to watch stuff like that just go in your room lock your door i don’t want to catch you okay so let me know want me to text you never mind  i’m in the middle of trying to deal with this whole situation with my son watchingthese videos and not going to work and while i’m doing this i get the mostrandom phone call i’ve ever gotten my publicist calls me up and she’s like gabe snoop dogg is looking for you excuse me snoop dogg you know– i know who snoop dogg is what do you mean he’s looking for me well he’s looking– is he looking for me or is he looking for me he’s a fan and he wants to interview you oh cool sounds good what is it i think it’s some type of podcast i’m in can i bring frankie absolutely cool so i hang up the phone i’m excited i want to tell my son i’m like frankie i’m walking towards your room  i’ll be at your door in three two one hey alright you’re dressed good come on let’s go where are we going watch we get in the car  and now we’re off on this adventure to go do an interview with snoop dogg you guys let me tell you something we get to the neighborhood and we’re lost the gps says we’re there but we’re lost we’re looking for a house and there’s no house just a big building and so i’m like this doesn’t look– a podcast really so i pull up to the security gate  tap the button on the wall  security desk can i help you hey security desk my name is gabriel iglesias i think i’m here to do an interview with snoop dogg okay one moment oh okay this is it good good i’m so excited snoop dogg it’s gonna be cool right  sir yes yes hi there’s no gilbert ignazios on file what could it be another name another name i don’t know fluffy maybe  and the gate starts to open  i’m like oh my god i’m officially in the rappers’ world because my real name doesn’t mean shit  so we drive in  and we’re passing all of these reserved parking spaces reserved reserved reserved reserved and we get to my space which is basically an orange cone that has fluffy handwritten on it and a bunch of other names crossed off  so frankie moves the cone i park the car  we walk into the building my publicist is waiting for me right she’s like gabe you made it frankie how are you listen i just finished talking to snoop  wow he is everything you think he is and just a little bit more he is so sweet i cannot believe he was charged with double murder  he told me to just walk you guys into the studio and he’ll be right back he said he had to go outside and get in the right headspace or something… okay cool so she walks us into snoop’s studio i’m thinking i’m there for a podcast come to find out it’s for a tv show snoop has a tv show where he interviews celebrities everyone in the room is waiting for snoop to return you can hear the small talk   all of a sudden everyone stands up and i’m looking around like what’s going on and i look at the door to see if snoop’s walking in and i don’t see him and icould see my son dad  i don’t realize it but snoop is entering the room through a different door i don’t realize it till like the last second i’m like what do you– so i jump up i push in my chair i’m so nervous i don’t know how to address him so i’m like…  i felt stupid hi  snoop walks over to me and he’s socool you guys he’s so cool he walks over to me and he grabs my hand he’s really strong he pulls me in and he says yo what it dobaby boo howyou feel  thank you for having me yeah can i sit down for sure  i sit down i look over i see my son my son’s like…  the difference between snoop’s show versus any other talk show i’ve ever done is that usually there’s a person like a produceror a director who comes to you and givesyou information like how the show begins topics you’re going to cover how you go to commercial how you come back from commercial… i’ve spoken to no one snoop just starts talking and at some point they hit record i’m waiting for action or a buzzer  something snoop just starts talking to me yo what up big fluff big fluff oh that’s– hey  yo you like music snoop i love music i love your music yeah that’s what’s up he opens up a laptop computer and then hehits play and the next thing i know we are listening to hardcore mexican banda music i mean hardcore  and you can hear gunshots in the song     and then a cow   and the whole time snoop is like i loveit when he go moo  what i feel like he’s messing with me because i’m mexican right so i called him out i said snoop do you understand what you’re listening to and he said this and it’s scared me he said gangster recognize gangster  the reason why it scared me was because he was telling the truth we were listening to actual mexicancartel songs that don’t play on the radio and the fact that he knew that the fact that his level of street knowledge in another language was that on point i said i gotta shut the hell up  don’t speak unless spoken to that’s the code next thing i know snoop reaches under the desk and he pulls out the biggestblunt i have ever seen  oh this sucker was huge as soon as he pulled out that freaking blunt got excited because i wanted to grab my cell phone okay i wanted to grab my cell phone so that i could take a selfie of snoop in thebackground being snoop so while i’m fumbling trying to get my phone snoop starts talking to me again yo big fluff yeah what hit that while i hit this  the second i went like that all of thecameras in the room red light red lightred light red light red light my publicist is like no my son is like yeah and now i’m being faced bro i’m being faced with a serious situation because you know i’ve talked about friends participating and doing stuff like this but i’ve never openly talked about myself… you know… and now i realized that from this moment forward people are going to know what happened here with snoop so i started trying to find ways to justify it to myself you know… if you’re going to do something like this on camera you want it to be with snoop  you want it to be with snoop cheech and chong…  …or willie nelson  next thing i know the manager hands me a lighter i light it and i take a big hit  so listen i’m doing my best to hold in all this smoke because i don’t want to look like a punk in front of snoop dogg i’m trying i’m fighting bro it’s hard you know   the whole time snoop is like hell yeah that’s what i’m saying fluffy going puffy today  i do not remember the rest of the interview what i remember is my buddy anthony telling snoop dogg and i to stand up for a picture stand up get up for a picture and so snoop and i both stand up to take this picture i put my arm around him i have to put my arm around him because he’s much taller than me okay snoop has me by at least five inches shut up alright   you guys are laughing at the wrong jokes   bowwow   bowwow everybody’s like this is a family show well apparently that’s how families are made that was too funny sir that was too funny it’s sad how hard she laughed at that as she looked right at you  i said snoop has me by at least five inches and she’s like…  almost like she wasn’t even laughing at me she was like laughing at you so apparently you guys have some story that i just reignited and now it’s awkward for all the kids  so anyway… snoop and i are taking photos and then ican hear my son dad dad  oh um snoop can my son take a photo with you yeah get over here and so frankie runs up you guys and he’s so cute because he’s geeking out reallyhard he’s like…  snoop this is my son frankie frankie say hello to snoop and snoop looks at me and he’s so cool snoop is like… yo this your kid what up baby fluff  and frankie’s like…  i don’t like that name that’s too bad get a job go go so snoop and frankie go into the corner to take pictures meanwhile i walk backover to the desk because i want to grabthe sheet that has snoop’s name and myname on it i want to have snoop autograph itso that i can frame it and put it on my wall while i’m doing that frankie walks up from behind me and he whispers in my ear trying to be all cool dad dad huh what what dad would it be okay if i finish smoking that with snoop  now i am being faced with the biggest moral decision of my life and i’m high and my mind is racing a thousand miles an hour i’m like should i let him should i not am i a good dad am i a bad dad what’s his mom gonna think i need a snickers i’m just– and then i thought about it you know… frankie you’re over  technically you don’t have to ask me if you don’t want to so as far as i’m–  where’d you go a minute later i am recording my son in a cloud with snoop dogg  and then i sent the video to his mom  hashtag biscuit blocker yes i did  now did thisactually happen yes it did you can go online and watch the video on youtube punch in snoop dogg next to that put fluffy or gabriel and you can see thewhole thing let me know how it turns out  the fact that i got to meet snoop was awesome he looked for me but every now and then i goout and i want to meet people i want to see cool things for example comedy i’m a huge fan of comedy not just performing it but i love going to shows i go to a comedyshow every now and then alone now i don’t know if that sounds weird to you guys but for me to do anything nowadays by myself… it’s my crew all the people that work for me they freak out when i go places they’re always concerned for my safety what if someone tries to kidnap you  well they’re going to earn it  i got into a fight with some of my team members and i said you know what i’m going out i bought myself a ticket and i went to gowatch chris rock one night in concert  now i says you know what maybe i can make my way backstage and i don’t know if i get lucky maybe i’ll say hi to him i’ve always wanted to meet him so i go to the side of the stage and irun into security and i said hey he looked at me and said fluffy when he did that i said hey listen i forgot my keys i’ll be right back and the guy’s like yeah keep going get your keys i’m like oh my god that shit worked  just like that i snuck backstage at a chris rock concert once i was behind the curtain i was in my element i knew where everything was i knew where the food was i knew where the dressing rooms were where the bathrooms were… i’m walking around with a soda people are coming up to me we didn’t know you were going to be here i got a call last minute  looking for my keys  i says you know what i got this far i’m going to push it i want to meet him i’ve always wanted to meet chris rock it was not hard once i was back there i just had to go to the dressing rooms all i had to do was read the name on the door i’m standing there in front of the door and i’m hyperventilating   the door opens up and there’s this man inthere this bodyguard who’s just massive i’m a big guy but damn he was huge as soon as he opened the door…    for real welcome to jurassic– big grandote and i’m standing there and i’m like… hi and he’s like can i help you yes my name is gabriel i’m a comedian and i wanted to see if i could say hi to chris rock if that’s possible you say you comedian yes well then you understand chris is going over his material right now he really ain’t trying to talk to nobody so i’ll tell you what player if you want to come by after the show you’re more than welcome to but right now it’s not a good time chris rock is a busy man   can i wave excuse me can i wave what you mean can i wave to chris i don’t have to come in can i wave chris rock is in the room he can hear the stupid conversation that’s taking place  i know this because i can hear chris rock in the background what’s going on who’s at the door move out the way yo chris i got this mani got this move alright the guy stands to the side and now i’m lookingat chris rock and he recognized me and it freaked me out oh yeah it freaked me out he’s like oh shit look who it islook who it is it’s the king of the mexicans  chris rock called me the king of the mexicans for the rest of the show everyone referred to me as el chapo i was celebrating the fact that i got away with that for so long for so long i snuck backstage at chris rock i snuck backstage i snuck– until karmashowed up one day in the form of the most extreme fan i have ever had in  years of me being a comedian i had someone who not only made it backstage this person paid to get into my dressing room okay yeah he didn’t pay me by the way he didn’t pay me i’m an honest hoe okay i made no money that day alright if i had gotten paid you wouldn’t be hearing this story here’s the thing i walk into my dressing room from the bathroom i just finished showering up and i’m in a towel i walk into the room come to find out later that this man was a very wealthy businessman in the community okay and when i walked into the room he’s wearing a very very nice suit so when i saw the suit i didn’t give ita second thought because he looked professional i thought maybe he was the general manager of the building one of theconcert promoters he could have been someone’s agent… so when i walked in the room in my towel right can i help you he looks at me and it was the most uncomfortable conversation i have ever had he looks at me and says listen   i am not here to waste any of your time fluffy i am prepared to take care of you i will give you a new lexus and an allowance that’s more than what you make as a comedian leave with me  i was never more disgusted and offended at the fact that i was not gay  because finally finally somebody wants to take care of me  do you know how many people i take care of no one’s ever offered me a lexus and they should i felt horrible saying no to this guy i still think about it  i still have the number  houston i’m going to tell you something and i don’t know how this is going to go over but i’m going to say it i would be an amazing gay partner  i would all the way up until that one part but even then  have you ever driven a lexus  those are nice sometimes you got to take one for your own teami’m just saying  now in all seriousness not to be funny not to be disrespectful let me tell you the reason why i would be an amazing gay partner the level the level of communication between two men is so high i might actually get an answer there might be clarity and understanding i might hear a yes i might hear a no do you know how many relationships i have been in where i still don’t know the outcome to certain conversations  very simple yes or no questions that’s what i would do something as simple as… bebé you hungry well… i haven’t eaten yet so i probably should eat something but i’m not feeling it right now but if i don’t eat right now you know how i’m gonna get later so i guess it’s probably a good idea if i start eating right now but it reallydepends on the options what do you think ah what about this one bebé where would you like to eat  you hear all the guys finally i’m not alone everybody’s pointing at somebody right now guys am i right this has to be– you would think that this is the safestquestion in the world to ask but it’s not well… just pick something you know me i go with the flow whatever you decide is okay with me you know me already just pick something alright we’re going to burger king i don’t like burger king why do we got to go to burger king burger king gives me chorro  chorro is mexican diarrhea how about this one how do you feel really really you want to know how i feel well maybe if you’d pay attention from time to time you might know how i feel you might notneed to have to ask me such a question because you would already know exactly how i feel you might have timeand energy i’m exhausted to let you know how i feel and you have the nerve to ask me ‘how do you feel now imagine the exact same conversation between me and mr lexus  do you know how efficient that conversation would be hey bro you hungry i thought you’d never ask what do you want to eat whatever you want to eat we’re going to burger king i love whoppers  me too we go to burger king and we tear it up we get back home and i ask him hey how do you feel horny  me too how do you want to do this heads ortails  it would be efficient  this is hypothetical but believe me i still think about it you know especially whenever i get into fights with my girl and she says something like oh you think you can do better i know i can have a lexus  i don’t know man i know we’re in the middle of a netflix taping whoever is running the light up there just want to make sure ’cause i keep moving and i stepped out of your light twice any other show i’d be like no problem no big deal but this is for netflix it’s the people that replaced comedy central  but no i’ll try not to move too fast but howslow are you if you can’t keep up with me  you should work for immigration  i’m just giving you a hard time i’m sorry i’m sorry ladies and gen– i apologize for that can we give a big round of applauseto our person running the spotlight up there  i honestly don’t think that the people that work behind the scenes like spotlight operators get enough credit whether it’s spotlight operators the people that run the cameras the peoplethat set up the stages the people that work security the people that run thebuilding without them there is no show and the same thing goes with me i got my own support team managers agentspromoters you know freaking merchandisepeople i have a bus driver named dave who has never received any credit and he’sbeen working for me for almost  years now this man…  this man hassuccessfully gotten me to every single comedy show on time without fail  if i had to describe him to you okay dave looks like the word ‘murica  not america ‘murica he’s about six feet tall and he’s white he has a gray beard and he wears a trucker hat and he’s got to be one of themost hardworking people i have ever met when i say hardworking hey i’m on the road  weeks out of the year so i know the difference is i fly home every monday tuesday wednesday dave stays on that bus and he gets it to the next city where we meet him he works anniversaries holidays special moments christmas time i was with my family dave was driving thatbus on the east coast new year’s i was with my family dave was on the eastcoast driving that bus one of the hardest working people i’ve ever met i just want to give a shoutout  in addition to being hardworking he’s uh– he’s very honest when i say honest i don’t mean oh he does his taxes right i mean painfully honest nofilter honest he talks the way people used to he does not have time to mince words he just calls it like he sees it before me he used to work with a man by the name of kenny g grammy award winner amazing amazing music um… one day kenny g was on his tour bus that dave was driving and i guess the two ofthem had a little discussion and kenny g used some wordsthat dave would’ve rather him not have used and instead of getting into it with him this is what dave does   kicked kenny g off of his own bus  because he would rather lose his job than lose his selfrespect and that’s the man i work with  he’s a bad dude you guys are clapping but you should’ve seen the interview oh man it was a good one  he looks at me and he says hey let’s get one thing straight i don’t give a shit who you are you treat me right i’ll treat you right you pay me on time you’ll live  not to mention the fact that he keeps that tour bus squeaky clean and he takes a lot of pride in that as well one night i was drinking on the bus and i go to put my cup down and i miss the table and the cup hit the floor i didn’t get up right away to get the cup because i figured i’ll get up in acouple minutes and make myself anotherdrink i’ll pick up the cup then dave sees the cup on the floor and then he looks at me and says hey i ain’t your mama pick that shit up  i get to the back of the bus and i’m like wait a minute i pay him hey dave… shut up yeah i’ll be in the back in my room thank you drive safe and people tell me you work with a man who talks that way to you why let me tell you why because he’s honest with dave you know exactly what you get nowadays it’s so hard for me to tell who’s being genuine and who has anagenda and with him you know exactly where you stand if he likes you he loves you and if notyou’re on the curb with kenny g  that being said i have a story to share  about a year and a half ago maybe longer we’re on the bus and we’re heading down the highway  just so you have kind of an understanding of the bus layout let’s say this is the front here’s dave the driver empty seat and then a sliding door that goesin between him and the rest of the tour bus my buddyalfred and i are in the living room portion and we’re watching tv we’re watching the news and on the news there’s this person who is running for some type of office no particular office  and i guess their big plan is to erect a structure…  …between two bodies of land  somewhere and i guess they want one sideof the structure to finance the entire project well my buddy alfred and i have a lot of family that works in construction and we know a bad job when we see one so we started to voice our opinion out loud about how we felt about this person and what they wanted to do we’re being very loud so loud dave can hear us and then we hear dave  ‘murica  i yell out to dave i say be quiet dave this isn’t about you he taps a button on the dashboard that activates the sliding door and when the door is about that far from closing he yells out i’m building a wall   i couldn’t even get upset because i wastoo much in shock over the fact that that came out of someone four feet away from me my buddy alfred and i we looked like chickens we’re like…  my cell phone goes off  i take out my phone and there’s a text message from dave  and i said that’s right he better say ‘i’m sorry’ he better say ‘just kidding i open up the text message and it says and you’re paying for it  and people tell me you still work withhim after that yes i do i trust that man with my life every single night i know where his heart’s at he can say whatever he wants at the endof the dayhe still has to drive around the king of the mexicans   the point to this story is just because you have a difference in opinion it doesn’t mean that you can’t have respect for one another you can’t have love for one another that you can’t have incrediblefriendships with one another it’s our differences that make usspecial what a lot of us need to work on is our delivery it’s all in the way you say things that’s why text messages are always misinterpreted ‘cause you read the text according to how you feel what does he mean ‘hello’ yeah anyway dave has gotten us to  of the states he doesn’t travel with us outside of america he prefers it that way last year we got a chance to do a european tourof  countries estonia germany norway belgium the netherlands uk…we’re just bouncing around all over the place and then we wound up on the other side of the worldout of all the countries i performed in my favorite country outside of home is australia and i’ll tell you why australia much like us in america has its list of priorities you know what’s not on theirlist political correctness they do not care about your feelings it’s like a country full of daves  believe it or not it’s very refreshing to be around such a large group of people who speak their minds so freely and if you know thatbefore you go there you’re going to have an amazing time but if you don’t knowthat and you show up it is a cultureshock and a half because i showed up andi didn’t know everybody says you got to see the beaches and i went to the beach i had people coming up to me hey somebody help me get him back in the water  yeah right there big fella look at you right there oh wait he’s moving he’s moving he’s moving oh he’s crying he’s crying i bet it tastes like gravy  it’s not bullying if everyone does it yeah that being said i’m in australia sydney australia at the opera house for me was one of the most iconic places i’ve ever got to perform in and it was bucketlist definitely after the show i want to go hang out with some aussies see what that was like i’m hanging out at a pub first things first australian people do not drink foster’s beer that’s an american thing they don’t drinkthat over there i tried ordering one to fit in didn’t go over well bartender looked at me you like the taste of piss do ya  okay don’t order that again so i’m hanging out with these two aussies and we’re drinking a rum called bundaberg at first glance it looks like a cocacola bottle because there’s a polar bear on the front and then you drink it and you’re like that’s not coke  as we’re talking a third australian joined the conversation and he sounded a little bit different from the other two he had more of a raspy voice more like…  he sounded like a drunk pirate underwater  these two guys didn’t like him so they called him a name and they left and nowit’s just me and drunk pirate we’re talking about life life in america life in australia talking about our differences he tells me that he’s a professional knife maker he’s showing me how it’s done he’s showing me pictures we wind up polishing off three bottles of this rum and drunk wasn’t even the right word to describe our level my tour manager ryan he comes up to meand he says gabe time to go and i look atryan and i’m like but ryan i just made a friend and he makes knives and they’re pretty my tour manager always knows how to talk to me no matter what condition i’m in if i’m drunk he knows better than to talk to me like i’m an adult he talks to me like i’m two he looks at me and he says hey buddy  you hungry  well listen if we don’t leave right now they’re gonna close mcdonald’s and you’re going to have to eat at the airport i gotta go alright mate you gotta go you gotta go no worries and he goes to shake my hand and when he shook my hand he put his personalpocket knife that he made in my hand as a gift that’s for you mate thanks for being nice thank you thank you i’ll cut cheeseburgers with this  we leave and we head to the restaurant  the manager at the restaurant recognized me he’s a big fan and he said hey stay aslong as you like shouldn’t have said that the plan was do the show go have some drinks get a bite to eat go to the hotel shower up and then go to the airport we stayed so long at the restaurant we had to go straight to the airport so we get there and you don’tsober up in like two hours after three bottles of rum i was not in airport condition  and so my tour manager has one hand on each shoulder right ryan’s trying to push me through the airport and you know he’s about  i’m not  and he’s pushing me with everything  and he gets me all the way to airport security and airport security in australia you don’t have to take off your shoes and i didn’t worry about taking off a belt because i don’t wear a belt ’cause i have a butt so he lines me up with airport security and he tells me i got to let you go don’t let me go i got to let you go don’t let me go and then he pushed me and i’m going forward and he yells out you’re a plane and the twoyearold came out i’m a plane  and now this fluffy is headed right for the metal detector and i can see the security officer on the other side  and when i got really close ryan yells out wings downwings down and i went through and i didn’t touch the edges but when i went through…   the knife  i sobered up for half a second because i realized oh my god i forgot to check the knife that the guy gave me and it’s on meand i’ve already cleared the freaking… youknow… so i’m like… the security officer does this eh go ahead  houston sober me would have internally celebrated the fact that i am not goingto prison for sneaking a knife past airport security and boarding a flight drunk me was offended  oh you can ask my buddy ryan was right behind me i looked at the security officer and i said hey hey how do you know how do you know i’m not a terrorist and i can hear my friends in line fuck  the security officer in uniform wearing a badge looks at me and says hey when have you ever seen a fat terrorist  eh look at him he’s crying i bet it tastes like gravy  yeah you guys i gotta tell you–  we love you fluffy what happened bro  we love you do you have a lexus  ‘cause i’m not passing that up again   sorry i just– but thank you  actually i’ve had some pretty awesome times over the last  years and whenever i talk to fans they havecertain questions about my past whether it’s my family my upbringing where my mom came from where my dad came from… certain stories i love the fact that i had someone ask me one time in your  years as a comedian what has been your greatest moment my greatest moment wasn’t even something that happened at a show but it wasbecause of what i was able to do for someone very special to me my mom who is no longer with us she meant everything to me she was my biggest supporter even though she would never laugh at my jokes she would get mad at her friends that wouldn’t laugh ¿pendejo por que no te ríes  how come you don’t laugh i did something really awesome for my mom before she passed away i took her to go see a man by the name of vicente fernandez  in concert now if you’re not familiar with who vicente fernandez is he is basically mexican elvis but he’s still alive  so a few years ago vicente fernandez and myself were both performing at the same venue a venue calledthe gibson amphitheatre in los angeles it is no longer there a woman by the name of emily was running the building i was there the week before vicente fernandez and after three soldout shows she comes up to me and says gabriel thank you so much for this incredible business we’re so happy with how the shows turned out i have a question for you is your mom a fan of vicente fernandez i said emily my mom’s mexican  it’s the law  i thought so listen vicente fernandez is going to be performing here next week and i wanted to do something very special for you to show my appreciation do you think you and your mom would like to come see him perform and i’ll get youfrontrow center i said emily that sounds amazing i’m pretty sure the answer is yes but my mom is old school so i still got to ask i’ll call you so i get to my mom’s house and i see her mama dime mi hijo mi hijo in spanish means my son so my mom would always tell me that my son mi hijo mi hijo dime mi hijo tell me my son i said mom would you like to go see vicente fernandez in concert and she looked at me and said mi hijo that sounds nice that’s exactly how she said it she was very evenkeeled she wouldn’t show a lot of emotion so i call emily and i said my mom’s in awesome i’ll see you next week so we get to the venue and we’re early so they have us in this little vip section where they’re giving us free drinks and free snacks and my mom was so cute she walks up to me and she says mi hijo are the drinks free i said mom yeah the drinks are free but don’t worry about it no no no mi hijoi didn’t bring any money i don’t have no money i said mom you made an atm you’re good   the messed up part is that she didn’t even like drinking she just wanted to walk around with a couple of drinks so she’d look like she was part of the party  you know so she’s got a couple drinks and as it was when she’d walk around she’d have a little bit of a limp because she had just had toe surgery a couple months prior so she had kind of like a little– it looked like she was dancing  so she’s walking around here comes emily gabriel you made it i go yeah this is my mom emily this is my mom esther mom this is emily they’re free she knows they’re free she made this happen oh thank you thank you you’re the one who hired mi hijo gracias thank you so much emily goes can i talk to you for a second sure mom i’ll be right back what’s up emily gabriel do you think your mom would you like to meet vicente fernandez right now i said emily let me tell you something…  …if she says no i want to meet him  i’ll be right back mamá dime mi hijo emily wants to know if you would like to meet vicente fernandez right now mi hijo that sounds nice alright emily she’s in emily goes is she even a fan i go trust me that’s her reaction she’s good she has the whole housecovered with vicente fernandez records and cassettes okay we’re good so emily comes back and she puts the special vip bracelets on us with a little click and she walks us through a door into the backstage area as soon as we went through the door i knew exactly where we were i was just there a week ago so i got my mom arm in arm and we’re walking down the hallway okay come on mama let’s go let’s go we’re walking down the hallway and we’re getting closer and closer to vicente fernandez’s dressing room the door is wide open and i can hear acommotion coming out of the dressing room  and then a man and a woman exit the room and the man is holding on to the woman’s shoulders and he’s like it’s okay it’s okay it’s okay it’s okay and the woman looks destroyed okay  mascara is running down her face my mom sees that and she’s like mi hijo did you see that did you see the mascara…  with the mascara– parece puta la cabrona  sorry puta means friendly  so we get by the door and the closer we get we start to see aguy in the room then he comes to the door in the room there’s three people okay there’s vicente fernandez the photographer and a handler the handler comes to the door and you can tell by his voice that he works for like a mexican radio station ’cause he’s got that voice hola hola pasale pasale pasale in spanish means come on in so we start to walk into the room and let me tell you guys something if you grew up listening to vicente fernandez from a young age and you getthe opportunity to meet him it is seriously a religious experience my mom and i are entering the room the only thing missing is the freaking…   you don’t look at him you look at the floor out of respect you just look at the floor come on ma we get all the way up to him and i see boots and when i see the boots my mom and i both just…  he knows what you’re doing he knows you’re checking him out so what he does is he poses okay vicente stands there and he poses he’ll have the sombrero the hat to his side and then he doesn’t look at you he looks away  and he sticks his chest out and he standsthere looking like a bigass bottle of tapatio at costco   and then he looked at me  and he recognized me not as a comedian but because i was there the week before and my photo was hanging outside his door it was whoever is there last they always rotate the photo so he sees me andhe’s like mi hijo tu eres el muchacho que esta en la foto ahí afuera yeah that’s me outside yeah hola  oh vicente i’m sorry i’m sorry le presento… mi mamá  i’m like oh my god i think i just offered up my mom to vicente fernandez  she’s like  better late than never mom get him my mom starts walking up to vicente he was so nice he goes out to shake my mom’s hand and mymom grabs his hand and i don’t know where she got this strength and energy from butshe grabbed him and pulled him in hard like the video game get over here and then hooked him she hooked him and she starts screaming into his chest mi chente i’m like oh my god she’s getting horny  and he knew too ‘cause he was like quitamela quitamela the photographer the handler and me the three of us is what it took to pull her off of vicente we sit her down she’s bawling  mascara is running down her face  the photographer shaking his head i guess vicente had dinner earlier that night he was eating barbecue ’cause they had those wet naps barbecue wet naps and so we take the wet naps and we startcleaning the mascara off my mom’s face we stand her up we posed her and we took the picture emily comes over and she takes us and she escorts us to our seats in the front and for three hours… for three hours my mom was on her feet listening to him and she refused to sit down mom you should sit down– no ¿cómo qué és el chente holding a shot of tequila that she never drank  she just– she was–  three hours on her feet never once sat down that’s how powerful his music was  my mom felt no pain for that entire time and the minute that freaking concert was over tantaran tantan my feet oh my god mi hijo mis pies ay pinche callo oh my god my feet ay and i’m like oh great so now i gotta drag this living novela to the parking lot i helped her into the car my feet i told you to sit down you don’t sit for chente here comes emily did you guys have a good time i go emily we had the greatest time thank you so much i got something for you oh what’s that and she hands me an envelope and i open it and inside the envelope is the picture she printed it out for me and when ilooked at it i got so choked up because i have never seen my mom so happy in a picture and it’s not that she wouldn’t smile she would smile but it was that one two three cheese  but this one was like…  and what makes it extra special is that it’s the last photo i have of my mom and she was the happiest and i know that thatmoment wouldn’t be possible if i did not do this for a living  so thank you for that sorry now a lot of people are like we came to laugh…   houston i got to share this story twenty years ago when i started doing this okay the fact that we’re here tonight in an arena doing a

get pulled over one night two minutes after coming out of a krispy kreme drivethru you better still laugh houston i made a left turn instead of making a right turn but i wasn’t paying attention ’cause

forever i said forget this he’s taking too long i grab my box i put it on my lap i flipped it open hmm  hmm…  and just as i was about to tear it up the officer gets to the window you know why i

keep going  keep going  chills my son frankie when he graduated from high school i was very very proud of him and i was very excited and uh… for me it was very emotional because i was the one that got to take him to school on that last day and it meant a lot because you know what  i was allowed to leave him anywhere i wanted to i can leave him in the front i can leave him on the side i can put him in the back i can make him walk that wasn’t the case many years ago when i was taking him to elementary school and they had a designated dropoff area on the side of the school where they hadcones in the middle of the street they had a supervisor there with a walkietalkie and a whistle to make surethat your kids would get out of the car safely and onto the school grounds one day we’re late because the night before i had a big show like this one and people brought me chocolate cakes and i took the cakes home and my son killed one of the cakes and the next daythe cake…  …killed frankie  oh it was bad  chorro chocomilk for the nonmexicansyoohoo  for the nonmexicans with money nestle quik  same joke we get to the school there’s no longer supervisor no walkietalkie no whistle the gate’s locked i

get off here you’re late go  and he cracks the door and as soon as his foot hits the curb here comes the principal and i know who it is ’cause he’s freaking out right he’s like…  it’s the principal dude relax i’m  i don’t give a damn  here comes the principal and she’s doing this one  sir sir sir this is not the designated dropoff area please take your child to the other side of the school you cannot leave him here i was like watch this señora no sé lo que esta diciendo aqui estoy dejando a mi hijo el no se levantó a la mañana it’s not my fault yo no sé that’s how you do it homeboy that’s

macho man  i’ve got to be a macho  how are you   whoo oh man that’s a long walk  thank you so much houston  one year ago this city was flipped upside down by a hurricane un cabrón named harvey  and they said that this city would never be the same i think it’s beautiful that a year later we’re all here celebrating together the fact that this city is resilient and you guys persevered houston’s strong baby  that’s serious in all sincerity guys i’m not trying to kiss your ass i already got your money  freaking houston i love this town i’ve been coming here for  years twenty years started off performing at a comedy club called the last stop  and then of course we jumped over to the improv and then– i performed everywhere i even did a onenighter in tomball  that’s a long story for the people at home i won’t even get into that i want to give you guys a headsup and let you know now that tonight i feel extracomfortable you’re going to notice that you might hear a little bit more spanish than you normally would and you can’t do that just anywhere but you can do that in houston  now to everyone watching at home who is freaking out like oh my god i didn’t sign up for this  if i say something in spanish my promiseis to translate immediately so that everyone enjoys the show okay ‘cause i know the second i said spanish people are freaking out you know all the people that drove in from the woodlands are like hey  and for everyone at home what does he mean by that the people from the woodlands you know   i know he is not referring to us  the nerve of him he needs to go back where he came from over by airline road   that’s right i know where you keep your brown people  this is awesome this always pisses off netflix they’re like gabriel we really wish you would just do a show that’s general that everybody understands why do you have to make your show so personal only people in that city are going to get it well when you have an arena full of people you want them to get it you want that extra personal special touch i don’t care what they say i already got the check  ha so let me give you a headsup as to what has happened since the last time i did aspecial um my son frankie is now  years old nineteen years old high school graduate he has all his shots… ladies people tell me all the time why do you talk about your son so much because he won’t leave  does he like it when you talk about him i said no he hates it why do you do it ‘cause he won’t leave  i’ll tell you what he likes to do right now he likes to sit around the house and watch videos of other kids playing video games see some of you are clapping i didn’t know that was an actual thing i asked him what are you doing i’m watching other kids playing video games i said that’s– really why well they’re professionals i’m like why would you watch something that you could be doing ‘cause they’re professionals that’s dumb really dad every sunday i see you watching football  how come you don’t play i don’t even argue i just cut off the internet  my son’s problem right now is that he has according to him too many options okay that’s his problem i’m like poor guy i have so many options dad i don’t know what to do write them down put them on a wheel freaking–  today plumber  something the problem is we go places people findout he is my son and then they offer himopportunities he doesn’t understand that that’s not how the real world works i know about struggling and clawing and fighting for the opportunity to dosomething he doesn’t get it yet and that’s my fault for example i take him and his mom out to dinner okay i took them both to red lobster now houston me personally i love red lobster okay and not even for the seafood i’m talking about the biscuits  oh yeah  it’s real good  so we’re sitting there and we’re having aconversation with our son about life opportunity what does he want to do with himself… and as we’re talking to him the manager from red lobster walks over to our table and he’s being really cool right he’s like hey and i’m like hey he looks at my son is this theinfamous frankie and i say why yes it is he just graduated congratulations and he’s looking for a job the manager goes oh say no more and he gives my son a business card and then he starts to say listen frankie this is all you have to do just go online and fill out the application once it’s registered call me personally and i’ll see to it that you get an interview the only position we have available right now is for a host but there’s plenty ofroom for opportunity here at red lobster besides you got one hell of a reference and then he walked away and i was like oh my god i’m going to get free biscuits  my son looks at me and says i don’t want to work at red lobster i said frankie no one is making you work anywhere this is just another opportunity that you’re wasting okay no red lobster what’s your plan i don’t know i got frustrated so i raised my voice well you better start thinking his mom didn’t like that don’t talk to him like that i said look biscuit blocker…  see up to this point we have agreed on how we raise our son but in this situation she’s trying to protect him from the world i’m trying to prepare him for the world if he cannot handle me raising my voice to get his atte',\n",
              "  'ntion to see the bigger picture he’s not ready for a world that doesn’t care about his feelings  so i said you know what i got to have a oneonone with him i got to have a oneonone with uh–  so i take him out to the movies i take him out to the movies we get in the car we take off  a little  drive okay as we’re driving i figure i’ll have a little oneonone with him maybe this way it doesn’t feel like a talk talk i thought he understood what i was trying to say it’s late we’re leaving the movies we’re pulling out of the parking structure and out of the corner of myeye i see a cop car and i made a sound i waslike ugh and frankie goes what is it dad i say there’s a cop at the light what are you worried about he’s going to stop us how do you know watch  i made that left turn…  frankie’s losing it it’s happening i said relax i pull over  cop pulls up from behind  immediately  driver windows down   driver hands out the window serious  both of them i can’t i’m fat  he gets to the window and he’s got theflashlight and he shines the light right in my face he’s like license yeah yeah yeah yeah here he takes the license and then of course you know do you know why i stopped you officer no i don’t but i’m sure you’re about to tell me you don’t have a front plate on your car i said officer you’re absolutely right i do not have a front plate on my car but my name is actually on the front of the car excuse me my name is on the front of the car i own a  ford flex and the ford flex has theactual word flex written on the hood i have a friend who does custom automotive work and he took all theletters off the car except for the letter f and he made letters so that it spells fluffy on the hood okay yeah it sounds impressive  you can do it too for like  it’s not that bad they’re like refrigerator magnets you can even move them like one day a letter flew off and it said fuffy  que pendejo i know stupid right so… the officer walks around to the front of the car and he takes his flashlight and he shines the light right on the hood and he does this he goes i knew it and my son goes what does that mean i said that means we get to go oh houston for the first time in a long time my son was actually impressed by something that i did you got to figure this is not impressive to my son because he grew up in this environment okay this does– you saw that right i saw like a–  that’s like the third one i’ve seen this stuff keeps–  people upstairs from tomball keep talking  alright i’ll tell you guys what happened shakira performed here a few days ago and shakira has an amazing show okay she doesn’t just come out and…    together together   i think i just hurt myself  but there’s a part of her show where all of a sudden it was…  and there’s cannons with confetti that shoot everywhere right and i think that was leftover shakira  can we edit out the part where i burned  calories   oh my god so where was i oh this does nothing for my son and the reasonwhy i say that is because he grew up in this environment he’s been to a thousand shows he’s seen me on tv a million times it’s not a big deal but the fact that igot stopped by a cop and the coprecognized me and geeked out and let us go i earned street cred with my kid  yeah frankie was like that’s the coolest thing i’ve ever seen and i’m like hell yeah cos’ that’s right you better recognize player   we get home he woke up his mom mom you should’ve seen it we got stopped by the cops are you okay yeah they recognized dad and they let us go she stayed quiet and i told her huh i got recognized and she said ah  so my son what he likes to do now like i said frankie likes to stay home and watch videos i come downstairs one morning and he’s on his phone but the chair that he’s sitting in is turned facing the window which i thought was weird so i called to him frankie what are you doing nothing so he can’t hear– frankie he can’t hear so i walked up from behind and i realized that my son has little headphones that’s– oh okay okay yeah he’s not ignoring me so i look over his shoulder and i realize that my son is watching a film  and i don’t mean frozen  but those people look cold  so now i’m standing there watching it with him i’m not trying to bond or anything i’m just trying to figure out the conversation i need to have and now we’re both watching professionals  so i grabbed his headphone and i went… hey is that a good movie and he freaked out  and he threw the phone the phone came partially undone and you could hear it oh it was bad not my face not my face not my face he turned bright red and he starts walking back over how embarrassing how long have you been standing there i said long enough to know ‘not my face  are you going to tell my mom i said frankiei love you way too much to do that to you i would never tell your mom i’mma tell everybody else   hey don’t tell his mom  i said look i know you’re not going to stop watching stuff like this so just do me a favor don’t do this here you’re old enough now to watch whatever you want to watch but as long as you live in this house you cannot be watching stuff like that where your mom can catch you you’re not going to stop so just don’t do it here how do you know i’m not gonna stop ‘cause i haven’t stopped  matter of fact there’s a sequel to that  it’s called not my hair he said to me que cochino i know right  i said frankie you’re going to watch stuff like that just go in your room lock your door i don’t want ',\n",
              "  'to catch you okay so let me know want me to text you never mind  i’m in the middle of trying to deal with this whole situation with my son watchingthese videos and not going to work and while i’m doing this i get the mostrandom phone call i’ve ever gotten my publicist calls me up and she’s like gabe snoop dogg is looking for you excuse me snoop dogg you know– i know who snoop dogg is what do you mean he’s looking for me well he’s looking– is he looking for me or is he looking for me he’s a fan and he wants to interview you oh cool sounds good what is it i think it’s some type of podcast i’m in can i bring frankie absolutely cool so i hang up the phone i’m excited i want to tell my son i’m like frankie i’m walking towards your room  i’ll be at your door in three two one hey alright you’re dressed good come on let’s go where are we going watch we get in the car  and now we’re off on this adventure to go do an interview with snoop dogg you guys let me tell you something we get to the neighborhood and we’re lost the gps says we’re there but we’re lost we’re looking for a house and there’s no house just a big building and so i’m like this doesn’t look– a podcast really so i pull up to the security gate  tap the button on the wall  security desk can i help you hey security desk my name is gabriel iglesias i think i’m here to do an interview with snoop dogg okay one moment oh okay this is it good good i’m so excited snoop dogg it’s gonna be cool right  sir yes yes hi there’s no gilbert ignazios on file what could it be another name another name i don’t know fluffy maybe  and the gate starts to open  i’m like oh my god i’m officially in the rappers’ world because my real name doesn’t mean shit  so we drive in  and we’re passing all of these reserved parking spaces reserved reserved reserved reserved and we get to my space which is basically an orange cone that has fluffy handwritten on it and a bunch of other names crossed off  so frankie moves the cone i park the car  we walk into the building my publicist is waiting for me right she’s like gabe you made it frankie how are you listen i just finished talking to snoop  wow he is everything you think he is and just a little bit more he is so sweet i cannot believe he was charged with double murder  he told me to just walk you guys into the studio and he’ll be right back he said he had to go outside and get in the right headspace or something… okay cool so she walks us into snoop’s studio i’m thinking i’m there for a podcast come to find out it’s for a tv show snoop has a tv show where he interviews celebrities everyone in the room is waiting for snoop to return you can hear the small talk   all of a sudden everyone stands up and i’m looking around like what’s going on and i look at the door to see if snoop’s walking in and i don’t see him and icould see my son dad  i don’t realize it but snoop is entering the room through a different door i don’t realize it till like the last second i’m like what do you– so i jump up i push in my chair i’m so nervous i don’t know how to address him so i’m like…  i felt stupid hi  snoop walks over to me and he’s socool you guys he’s so cool he walks over to me and he grabs my hand he’s really strong he pulls me in and he says yo what it dobaby boo howyou feel  thank you for having me yeah can i sit down for sure  i sit down i look over i see my son my son’s like…  the difference between snoop’s show versus any other talk show i’ve ever done is that usually there’s a person like a produceror a director who comes to you and givesyou information like how the show begins topics you’re going to cover how you go to commercial how you come back from commercial… i’ve spoken to no one snoop just starts talking and at some point they hit record i’m waiting for action or a buzzer  something snoop just starts talking to me yo what up big fluff big fluff oh that’s– hey  yo you like music snoop i love music i love your music yeah that’s what’s up he opens up a laptop computer and then hehits play and the next thing i know we are listening to hardcore mexican banda music i mean hardcore  and you can hear gunshots in the song     and then a cow   and the whole time snoop is like i loveit when he go moo  what i feel like he’s messing with me because i’m mexican right so i called him out i said snoop do you understand what you’re listening to and he said this and it’s scared me he said gangster recognize gangster  the reason why it scared me was because he was telling the truth we were listening to actual mexicancartel songs that don’t play on the radio and the fact that he knew that the fact that his level of street knowledge in another language was that on point i said i gotta shut the hell up  don’t speak unless spoken to that’s the code next thing i know snoop reaches under the desk and he pulls out the biggestblunt i have ever seen  oh this sucker was huge as soon as he pulled out that freaking blunt got excited because i wanted to grab my cell phone okay i wanted to grab my cell phone so that i could take a selfie of snoop in thebackground being snoop so while i’m fumbling trying to get my phone snoop starts talking to me again yo big fluff yeah what hit that while i hit this  the second i went like that all of thecameras in the room red light red lightred light red light red light my publicist is like no my son is like yeah and now i’m being faced bro i’m being faced with a serious situation',\n",
              "  ' because you know i’ve talked about friends participating and doing stuff like this but i’ve never openly talked about myself… you know… and now i realized that from this moment forward people are going to know what happened here with snoop so i started trying to find ways to justify it to myself you know… if you’re going to do something like this on camera you want it to be with snoop  you want it to be with snoop cheech and chong…  …or willie nelson  next thing i know the manager hands me a lighter i light it and i take a big hit  so listen i’m doing my best to hold in all this smoke because i don’t want to look like a punk in front of snoop dogg i’m trying i’m fighting bro it’s hard you know   the whole time snoop is like hell yeah that’s what i’m saying fluffy going puffy today  i do not remember the rest of the interview what i remember is my buddy anthony telling snoop dogg and i to stand up for a picture stand up get up for a picture and so snoop and i both stand up to take this picture i put my arm around him i have to put my arm around him because he’s much taller than me okay snoop has me by at least five inches shut up alright   you guys are laughing at the wrong jokes   bowwow   bowwow everybody’s like this is a family show well apparently that’s how families are made that was too funny sir that was too funny it’s sad how hard she laughed at that as she looked right at you  i said snoop has me by at least five inches and she’s like…  almost like she wasn’t even laughing at me she was like laughing at you so apparently you guys have some story that i just reignited and now it’s awkward for all the kids  so anyway… snoop and i are taking photos and then ican hear my son dad dad  oh um snoop can my son take a photo with you yeah get over here and so frankie runs up you guys and he’s so cute because he’s geeking out reallyhard he’s like…  snoop this is my son frankie frankie say hello to snoop and snoop looks at me and he’s so cool snoop is like… yo this your kid what up baby fluff  and frankie’s like…  i don’t like that name that’s too bad get a job go go so snoop and frankie go into the corner to take pictures meanwhile i walk backover to the desk because i want to grabthe sheet that has snoop’s name and myname on it i want to have snoop autograph itso that i can frame it and put it on my wall while i’m doing that frankie walks up from behind me and he whispers in my ear trying to be all cool dad dad huh what what dad would it be okay if i finish smoking that with snoop  now i am being faced with the biggest moral decision of my life and i’m high and my mind is racing a thousand miles an hour i’m like should i let him should i not am i a good dad am i a bad dad what’s his mom gonna think i need a snickers i’m just– and then i thought about it you know… frankie you’re over  technically you don’t have to ask me if you don’t want to so as far as i’m–  where’d you go a minute later i am recording my son in a cloud with snoop dogg  and then i sent the video to his mom  hashtag biscuit blocker yes i did  now did thisactually happen yes it did you can go online and watch the video on youtube punch in snoop dogg next to that put fluffy or gabriel and you can see thewhole thing let me know how it turns out  the fact that i got to meet snoop was awesome he looked for me but every now and then i goout and i want to meet people i want to see cool things for example comedy i’m a huge fan of comedy not just performing it but i love going to shows i go to a comedyshow every now and then alone now i don’t know if that sounds weird to you guys but for me to do anything nowadays by myself… it’s my crew all the people that work for me they freak out when i go places they’re always concerned for my safety what if someone tries to kidnap you  well they’re going to earn it  i got into a fight with some of my team members and i said you know what i’m going out i bought myself a ticket and i went to gowatch chris rock one night in concert  now i says you know what maybe i can make my way backstage and i don’t know if i get lucky maybe i’ll say hi to him i’ve always wanted to meet him so i go to the side of the stage and irun into security and i said hey he looked at me and said fluffy when he did that i said hey listen i forgot my keys i’ll be right back and the guy’s like yeah keep going get your keys i’m like oh my god that shit worked  just like that i snuck backstage at a chris rock concert once i was behind the curtain i was in my element i knew where everything was i knew where the food was i knew where the dressing rooms were where the bathrooms were… i’m walking around with a soda people are coming up to me we didn’t know you were going to be here i got a call last minute  looking for my keys  i says you know what i got this far i’m going to push it i want to meet him i’ve always wanted to meet chris rock it was not hard once i was back there i just had to go to the dressing rooms all i had to do was read the name on the door i’m standing there in front of the door and i’m hyperventilating   the door opens up and there’s this man inthere this bodyguard who’s just massive i’m a big guy but damn he was huge as soon as he opened the door…    for real welcome to jurassic– big grandote and i’m standing there and i’m like… hi and he’s like can i help you yes my name is gabriel i’m a comedian and i wanted to see if i could say hi to chris rock if that’s possible you',\n",
              "  ' say you comedian yes well then you understand chris is going over his material right now he really ain’t trying to talk to nobody so i’ll tell you what player if you want to come by after the show you’re more than welcome to but right now it’s not a good time chris rock is a busy man   can i wave excuse me can i wave what you mean can i wave to chris i don’t have to come in can i wave chris rock is in the room he can hear the stupid conversation that’s taking place  i know this because i can hear chris rock in the background what’s going on who’s at the door move out the way yo chris i got this mani got this move alright the guy stands to the side and now i’m lookingat chris rock and he recognized me and it freaked me out oh yeah it freaked me out he’s like oh shit look who it islook who it is it’s the king of the mexicans  chris rock called me the king of the mexicans for the rest of the show everyone referred to me as el chapo i was celebrating the fact that i got away with that for so long for so long i snuck backstage at chris rock i snuck backstage i snuck– until karmashowed up one day in the form of the most extreme fan i have ever had in  years of me being a comedian i had someone who not only made it backstage this person paid to get into my dressing room okay yeah he didn’t pay me by the way he didn’t pay me i’m an honest hoe okay i made no money that day alright if i had gotten paid you wouldn’t be hearing this story here’s the thing i walk into my dressing room from the bathroom i just finished showering up and i’m in a towel i walk into the room come to find out later that this man was a very wealthy businessman in the community okay and when i walked into the room he’s wearing a very very nice suit so when i saw the suit i didn’t give ita second thought because he looked professional i thought maybe he was the general manager of the building one of theconcert promoters he could have been someone’s agent… so when i walked in the room in my towel right can i help you he looks at me and it was the most uncomfortable conversation i have ever had he looks at me and says listen   i am not here to waste any of your time fluffy i am prepared to take care of you i will give you a new lexus and an allowance that’s more than what you make as a comedian leave with me  i was never more disgusted and offended at the fact that i was not gay  because finally finally somebody wants to take care of me  do you know how many people i take care of no one’s ever offered me a lexus and they should i felt horrible saying no to this guy i still think about it  i still have the number  houston i’m going to tell you something and i don’t know how this is going to go over but i’m going to say it i would be an amazing gay partner  i would all the way up until that one part but even then  have you ever driven a lexus  those are nice sometimes you got to take one for your own teami’m just saying  now in all seriousness not to be funny not to be disrespectful let me tell you the reason why i would be an amazing gay partner the level the level of communication between two men is so high i might actually get an answer there might be clarity and understanding i might hear a yes i might hear a no do you know how many relationships i have been in where i still don’t know the outcome to certain conversations  very simple yes or no questions that’s what i would do something as simple as… bebé you hungry well… i haven’t eaten yet so i probably should eat something but i’m not feeling it right now but if i don’t eat right now you know how i’m gonna get later so i guess it’s probably a good idea if i start eating right now but it reallydepends on the options what do you think ah what about this one bebé where would you like to eat  you hear all the guys finally i’m not alone everybody’s pointing at somebody right now guys am i right this has to be– you would think that this is the safestquestion in the world to ask but it’s not well… just pick something you know me i go with the flow whatever you decide is okay with me you know me already just pick something alright we’re going to burger king i don’t like burger king why do we got to go to burger king burger king gives me chorro  chorro is mexican diarrhea how about this one how do you feel really really you want to know how i feel well maybe if you’d pay attention from time to time you might know how i feel you might notneed to have to ask me such a question because you would already know exactly how i feel you might have timeand energy i’m exhausted to let you know how i feel and you have the nerve to ask me ‘how do you feel now imagine the exact same conversation between me and mr lexus  do you know how efficient that conversation would be hey bro you hungry i thought you’d never ask what do you want to eat whatever you want to eat we’re going to burger king i love whoppers  me too we go to burger king and we tear it up we get back home and i ask him hey how do you feel horny  me too how do you want to do this heads ortails  it would be efficient  this is hypothetical but believe me i still think about it you know especially whenever i get into fights with my girl and she says something like oh you think you can do better i know i can have a lexus  i don’t know man i know we’re in the middle of a netflix taping whoever is running the light up there just want to make sure ’cause i keep moving and i stepped out of your light twic',\n",
              "  'e any other show i’d be like no problem no big deal but this is for netflix it’s the people that replaced comedy central  but no i’ll try not to move too fast but howslow are you if you can’t keep up with me  you should work for immigration  i’m just giving you a hard time i’m sorry i’m sorry ladies and gen– i apologize for that can we give a big round of applauseto our person running the spotlight up there  i honestly don’t think that the people that work behind the scenes like spotlight operators get enough credit whether it’s spotlight operators the people that run the cameras the peoplethat set up the stages the people that work security the people that run thebuilding without them there is no show and the same thing goes with me i got my own support team managers agentspromoters you know freaking merchandisepeople i have a bus driver named dave who has never received any credit and he’sbeen working for me for almost  years now this man…  this man hassuccessfully gotten me to every single comedy show on time without fail  if i had to describe him to you okay dave looks like the word ‘murica  not america ‘murica he’s about six feet tall and he’s white he has a gray beard and he wears a trucker hat and he’s got to be one of themost hardworking people i have ever met when i say hardworking hey i’m on the road  weeks out of the year so i know the difference is i fly home every monday tuesday wednesday dave stays on that bus and he gets it to the next city where we meet him he works anniversaries holidays special moments christmas time i was with my family dave was driving thatbus on the east coast new year’s i was with my family dave was on the eastcoast driving that bus one of the hardest working people i’ve ever met i just want to give a shoutout  in addition to being hardworking he’s uh– he’s very honest when i say honest i don’t mean oh he does his taxes right i mean painfully honest nofilter honest he talks the way people used to he does not have time to mince words he just calls it like he sees it before me he used to work with a man by the name of kenny g grammy award winner amazing amazing music um… one day kenny g was on his tour bus that dave was driving and i guess the two ofthem had a little discussion and kenny g used some wordsthat dave would’ve rather him not have used and instead of getting into it with him this is what dave does   kicked kenny g off of his own bus  because he would rather lose his job than lose his selfrespect and that’s the man i work with  he’s a bad dude you guys are clapping but you should’ve seen the interview oh man it was a good one  he looks at me and he says hey let’s get one thing straight i don’t give a shit who you are you treat me right i’ll treat you right you pay me on time you’ll live  not to mention the fact that he keeps that tour bus squeaky clean and he takes a lot of pride in that as well one night i was drinking on the bus and i go to put my cup down and i miss the table and the cup hit the floor i didn’t get up right away to get the cup because i figured i’ll get up in acouple minutes and make myself anotherdrink i’ll pick up the cup then dave sees the cup on the floor and then he looks at me and says hey i ain’t your mama pick that shit up  i get to the back of the bus and i’m like wait a minute i pay him hey dave… shut up yeah i’ll be in the back in my room thank you drive safe and people tell me you work with a man who talks that way to you why let me tell you why because he’s honest with dave you know exactly what you get nowadays it’s so hard for me to tell who’s being genuine and who has anagenda and with him you know exactly where you stand if he likes you he loves you and if notyou’re on the curb with kenny g  that being said i have a story to share  about a year and a half ago maybe longer we’re on the bus and we’re heading down the highway  just so you have kind of an understanding of the bus layout let’s say this is the front here’s dave the driver empty seat and then a sliding door that goesin between him and the rest of the tour bus my buddyalfred and i are in the living room portion and we’re watching tv we’re watching the news and on the news there’s this person who is running for some type of office no particular office  and i guess their big plan is to erect a structure…  …between two bodies of land  somewhere and i guess they want one sideof the structure to finance the entire project well my buddy alfred and i have a lot of family that works in construction and we know a bad job when we see one so we started to voice our opinion out loud about how we felt about this person and what they wanted to do we’re being very loud so loud dave can hear us and then we hear dave  ‘murica  i yell out to dave i say be quiet dave this isn’t about you he taps a button on the dashboard that activates the sliding door and when the door is about that far from closing he yells out i’m building a wall   i couldn’t even get upset because i wastoo much in shock over the fact that that came out of someone four feet away from me my buddy alfred and i we looked like chickens we’re like…  my cell phone goes off  i take out my phone and there’s a text message from dave  and i said that’s right he better say ‘i’m sorry’ he better say ‘just kidding i open up the text message and it says and you’re paying for it  and people tell me you still work withhim after that yes i do i trust that man with my life every',\n",
              "  ' single night i know where his heart’s at he can say whatever he wants at the endof the dayhe still has to drive around the king of the mexicans   the point to this story is just because you have a difference in opinion it doesn’t mean that you can’t have respect for one another you can’t have love for one another that you can’t have incrediblefriendships with one another it’s our differences that make usspecial what a lot of us need to work on is our delivery it’s all in the way you say things that’s why text messages are always misinterpreted ‘cause you read the text according to how you feel what does he mean ‘hello’ yeah anyway dave has gotten us to  of the states he doesn’t travel with us outside of america he prefers it that way last year we got a chance to do a european tourof  countries estonia germany norway belgium the netherlands uk…we’re just bouncing around all over the place and then we wound up on the other side of the worldout of all the countries i performed in my favorite country outside of home is australia and i’ll tell you why australia much like us in america has its list of priorities you know what’s not on theirlist political correctness they do not care about your feelings it’s like a country full of daves  believe it or not it’s very refreshing to be around such a large group of people who speak their minds so freely and if you know thatbefore you go there you’re going to have an amazing time but if you don’t knowthat and you show up it is a cultureshock and a half because i showed up andi didn’t know everybody says you got to see the beaches and i went to the beach i had people coming up to me hey somebody help me get him back in the water  yeah right there big fella look at you right there oh wait he’s moving he’s moving he’s moving oh he’s crying he’s crying i bet it tastes like gravy  it’s not bullying if everyone does it yeah that being said i’m in australia sydney australia at the opera house for me was one of the most iconic places i’ve ever got to perform in and it was bucketlist definitely after the show i want to go hang out with some aussies see what that was like i’m hanging out at a pub first things first australian people do not drink foster’s beer that’s an american thing they don’t drinkthat over there i tried ordering one to fit in didn’t go over well bartender looked at me you like the taste of piss do ya  okay don’t order that again so i’m hanging out with these two aussies and we’re drinking a rum called bundaberg at first glance it looks like a cocacola bottle because there’s a polar bear on the front and then you drink it and you’re like that’s not coke  as we’re talking a third australian joined the conversation and he sounded a little bit different from the other two he had more of a raspy voice more like…  he sounded like a drunk pirate underwater  these two guys didn’t like him so they called him a name and they left and nowit’s just me and drunk pirate we’re talking about life life in america life in australia talking about our differences he tells me that he’s a professional knife maker he’s showing me how it’s done he’s showing me pictures we wind up polishing off three bottles of this rum and drunk wasn’t even the right word to describe our level my tour manager ryan he comes up to meand he says gabe time to go and i look atryan and i’m like but ryan i just made a friend and he makes knives and they’re pretty my tour manager always knows how to talk to me no matter what condition i’m in if i’m drunk he knows better than to talk to me like i’m an adult he talks to me like i’m two he looks at me and he says hey buddy  you hungry  well listen if we don’t leave right now they’re gonna close mcdonald’s and you’re going to have to eat at the airport i gotta go alright mate you gotta go you gotta go no worries and he goes to shake my hand and when he shook my hand he put his personalpocket knife that he made in my hand as a gift that’s for you mate thanks for being nice thank you thank you i’ll cut cheeseburgers with this  we leave and we head to the restaurant  the manager at the restaurant recognized me he’s a big fan and he said hey stay aslong as you like shouldn’t have said that the plan was do the show go have some drinks get a bite to eat go to the hotel shower up and then go to the airport we stayed so long at the restaurant we had to go straight to the airport so we get there and you don’tsober up in like two hours after three bottles of rum i was not in airport condition  and so my tour manager has one hand on each shoulder right ryan’s trying to push me through the airport and you know he’s about  i’m not  and he’s pushing me with everything  and he gets me all the way to airport security and airport security in australia you don’t have to take off your shoes and i didn’t worry about taking off a belt because i don’t wear a belt ’cause i have a butt so he lines me up with airport security and he tells me i got to let you go don’t let me go i got to let you go don’t let me go and then he pushed me and i’m going forward and he yells out you’re a plane and the twoyearold came out i’m a plane  and now this fluffy is headed right for the metal detector and i can see the security officer on the other side  and when i got really close ryan yells out wings downwings down and i went through and i didn’t touch the edges but when i went through…   the knife  i sobered up for half a second because i realiz',\n",
              "  'ed oh my god i forgot to check the knife that the guy gave me and it’s on meand i’ve already cleared the freaking… youknow… so i’m like… the security officer does this eh go ahead  houston sober me would have internally celebrated the fact that i am not goingto prison for sneaking a knife past airport security and boarding a flight drunk me was offended  oh you can ask my buddy ryan was right behind me i looked at the security officer and i said hey hey how do you know how do you know i’m not a terrorist and i can hear my friends in line fuck  the security officer in uniform wearing a badge looks at me and says hey when have you ever seen a fat terrorist  eh look at him he’s crying i bet it tastes like gravy  yeah you guys i gotta tell you–  we love you fluffy what happened bro  we love you do you have a lexus  ‘cause i’m not passing that up again   sorry i just– but thank you  actually i’ve had some pretty awesome times over the last  years and whenever i talk to fans they havecertain questions about my past whether it’s my family my upbringing where my mom came from where my dad came from… certain stories i love the fact that i had someone ask me one time in your  years as a comedian what has been your greatest moment my greatest moment wasn’t even something that happened at a show but it wasbecause of what i was able to do for someone very special to me my mom who is no longer with us she meant everything to me she was my biggest supporter even though she would never laugh at my jokes she would get mad at her friends that wouldn’t laugh ¿pendejo por que no te ríes  how come you don’t laugh i did something really awesome for my mom before she passed away i took her to go see a man by the name of vicente fernandez  in concert now if you’re not familiar with who vicente fernandez is he is basically mexican elvis but he’s still alive  so a few years ago vicente fernandez and myself were both performing at the same venue a venue calledthe gibson amphitheatre in los angeles it is no longer there a woman by the name of emily was running the building i was there the week before vicente fernandez and after three soldout shows she comes up to me and says gabriel thank you so much for this incredible business we’re so happy with how the shows turned out i have a question for you is your mom a fan of vicente fernandez i said emily my mom’s mexican  it’s the law  i thought so listen vicente fernandez is going to be performing here next week and i wanted to do something very special for you to show my appreciation do you think you and your mom would like to come see him perform and i’ll get youfrontrow center i said emily that sounds amazing i’m pretty sure the answer is yes but my mom is old school so i still got to ask i’ll

would you like to go see vicente fernandez in concert and she looked at me and said mi hijo that sounds nice that’s exactly how she said it she was very evenkeeled she wouldn’t show a lot of emotion so i call emily and i said my mom’s in awesome i’ll see you next week so we get to the venue and we’re early so they have us in this little vip section where they’re giving us free drinks and free snacks and my mom was so cute she walks up to me and she says mi hijo are the drinks free i said mom yeah the drinks are free but don’t worry about it no no no mi hijoi didn’t bring any money i don’t have no money i said mom you made an atm you’re good   the messed up part is that she didn’t even like drinking she just wanted to walk around with a couple of drinks so she’d look like she was part of the party  you know so she’s got a couple drinks and as it was when she’d walk around she’d have a little bit of a limp because she had just had toe surgery a couple months prior so she had kind of like a little– it looked like she was dancing  so she’s walking around here comes emily gabriel you made it i go yeah this is my mom emily this is my mom esther mom this is emily they’re free she knows they’re free she made this happen oh thank you thank you you’re the one who hired mi hijo gracias thank you so much emily goes can i talk to you for a second sure mom i’ll be right back what’s

she has the whole housecovered with vicente fernandez records and cassettes okay we’re good so emily comes back and she puts the special vip bracelets on us with a little click and she walks us through a door into the backstage area as soon as we went through the door i knew exactly where we were i was just there a week ago so i got my mom arm in arm and we’re walking down the hallway okay come on mama let’s go let’s go we’re walking down the hallway and we’re getting closer and closer to vicente fernandez’s dressing room the door is wide open and i can hear acommotion coming out of the dressing room  and then a man and a woman exit the room and the man is holding on to the woman’s shoulders ',\n",
              "  'and he’s like it’s okay it’s okay it’s okay it’s okay and the woman looks destroyed okay  mascara is running down her face my mom sees that and she’s like mi hijo did you see that did you see the mascara…  with the mascara– parece puta la cabrona  sorry puta means friendly  so we get by the door and the closer we get we start to see aguy in the room then he comes to the door in the room there’s three people okay there’s vicente fernandez the photographer and a handler the handler comes to the door and you can tell by his voice that he works for like a mexican radio station ’cause he’s got that voice hola hola pasale pasale pasale in spanish means come on in so we start to walk into the room and let me tell you guys something if you grew up listening to vicente fernandez from a young age and you getthe opportunity to meet him it is seriously a religious experience my mom and i are entering the room the only thing missing is the freaking…   you don’t look at him you look at the floor out of respect you just look at the floor come on ma we get all the way up to him and i see boots and when i see the boots my mom and i both just…  he knows what you’re doing he knows you’re checking him out so what he does is he poses okay vicente stands there and he poses he’ll have the sombrero the hat to his side and then he doesn’t look at you he looks away  and he sticks his chest out and he standsthere looking like a bigass bottle of tapatio at costco   and then he looked at me  and he recognized me not as a comedian but because i was there the week before and my photo was hanging outside his door it was whoever is there last they always rotate the photo so he sees me andhe’s like mi hijo tu eres el muchacho que esta en la foto ahí afuera yeah that’s me outside yeah hola  oh vicente i’m sorry i’m sorry le presento… mi mamá  i’m like oh my god i think i just offered up my mom to vicente fernandez  she’s like  better late than never mom get him my mom

like quitamela quitamela the photographer the handler and me the three of us is what it took to pull her off of vicente we sit her down she’s bawling  mascara is running down her face  the photographer shaking his head i guess vicente had dinner earlier that night he was eating barbecue ’cause they had those wet naps barbecue wet naps and so we take the wet naps and we startcleaning the mascara off my mom’s face we stand her up we posed her and we took the picture emily comes over and she takes us and she escorts us to our seats in the front and for three hours… for three hours my mom was on her feet listening to him and she refused to sit down mom you should sit down– no ¿cómo qué és el chente holding a shot of tequila that she never drank  she just– she was–  three hours on her feet never once sat down that’s how powerful his music was  my mom felt no pain for that entire time and the minute that freaking concert was over tantaran tantan my feet oh my god mi hijo mis pies ay pinche callo oh my god my feet ay and i’m like oh great so now i gotta drag this living novela to the parking lot i helped her into the car my feet i told you to sit down you don’t sit for

the envelope is the picture she printed it out for me and when ilooked at it i got so choked up because i have never seen my mom so happy in a picture and it’s not that she wouldn’t smile she would smile but it was that one two three cheese  but this one was like…  and what makes it extra special is that it’s the last photo i have of my mom and she was the happiest and i know that thatmoment wouldn’t be possible if i did not do this for a living  so thank you for that sorry now a lot of people are like we came to laugh…   houston i got to share this story twenty years ago when i started

thank you guys and i’m glad you could be here tonight twenty years doing this so i think it’s only right that tonight we close this show the way that the first one began  i get pulled over one night two minutes after coming out of a krispy kreme drivethru you better still laugh houston i made a left turn instead of making a right turn but i wasn’t paying attention ’cause i had a box right i was

keep going  chills my son frankie when he graduated from high school i was very very proud of him and i was very excited and uh… for me it was very emotional because i was the one that got to take him to school on that last day and it meant a lot because you know what  i was allowed to leave him anywhere i wanted to i can leave him in the front i can leave him on the side i can put him in the back i can make him walk that wasn’t the case many years ago when i was taking him to elementary school and they had a designated dropoff area on the side of the school where they hadcones in the middle of the street they had a supervisor there with a walkietalkie and a whistle to make surethat your kids would get out of the car safely and onto the school grounds one day we’re late because the night before i had a big show like this one and people brought me chocolate cakes and i took the cakes home and my son killed one of the cakes and the next daythe cake…  …killed frankie  oh it was bad  chorro chocomilk for the nonmexicansyoohoo  for the nonmexicans with money nestle quik  same joke we get to the school there’s no longer supervisor no walkietalkie no whistle the gate’s locked i said i’m not leaving my kid here i’m going to drop him off in front and iguess i wasn’t supposed to do that and i didn’t know and at the time i didn’t really care we pull up  go i’m not supposed to get off here you’re late go  and he cracks the door and as soon as his foot hits the curb here comes the principal and i know who it is ’cause he’s freaking out right he’s like…  it’s the principal dude relax i’m  i don’t give a damn  here comes the principal and she’s doing this one  sir sir sir this is not the designated dropoff area please take your child to the other side of the school you cannot leave him here i was like watch this señora no sé lo que esta diciendo aqui estoy dejando a mi hijo el no se levantó a la mañana it’s not my fault yo no sé that’s how you do it homeboy that’s how you do it

i’m out here i get to listen to the radio you guys have greatradio stations because you’re always in your cars in new york– radio’s not a big thing for me living in new york i ride my bicycle walk the streets i can’t listen to music because i’ll die um…  but in la that’s all i do i just listen to music now these days when you’re driving all you hear is trap music that’s the big thing you hear is trap that’s the new music on the radio it’s really fun trap i don’t understand what they’re saying but i enjoy it  every single song is the same every trap song to me sounds like a toddler complaining about life that’s all i hear when i listen to trap songs every time a trap song plays on the radio i think of my little brother he’ll go outside and hurt himself he’ll come back crying it sounds like every single trap song ever he’ll walk in like…  i’ll be like yo isaac what happened      and i’ll be like yo yo yo dude slow down  i thought you were playing with your friends what happened  all my friends are dead   push me to the edge   all my friends are dead now   push me to the edge now   go talk to your mom i don’t know what you’re saying talk to your mom ah… the city of angels i love every moment man i’m enjoying myself i just got back from vacation so i’m having a great time you got that vacation swag you’ve still got that thing you know you still feel loose you feel relaxed i went to bali on vacation  out in indonesia yeah if you’ve never been make a plan and get out there it’s an amazing place uh i went out with some of my friends learned a few things about myself as a person the most important thing i learned is somebody needs to invent a tripadvisor specifically for black people right no because just generally i find that what white people want to do on vacation is what black people are trying to escape  and not in a bad way we just want different things out of life like my white friends are always inviting me camping for instance always with enthusiasm like trevor wanna go camping dude i’m like why  i was like dude what do you mean ‘why’ it’s amazing are you kidding me no water no electricity you know it’s just us and the great outdoors you’ve got to take a dump in the hole in the floor or something dude i’m like yeah that was my life  that was me growing up you know how hard i worked to never go camping again  every day  every day every day i wake up in my bed and i’m like thank god i’m not camping  if my family saw pictures of me camping they would be devastated if my grandmother saw me out in the woods  she’d be like what happened to trevor i thought he was successful oh  it must be the crack ah  i won’t go camping so i went with my friends to bali they planned the trip and uh before we went i asked my friend i was like yo mitch what are we going to be doing he was like don’t ask questions trevor it’s just gonna be a great time i was like i want to know what the great time is going to be about he was like dude don’t ask questions i should have asked questions  because we had fun but there were a few things that were weird that i wouldn’t necessarily do on my own for instance on the third day of the trip we had what was planned what was billed in our itinerary as an authentic balinese experience that’s what they called it an authentic balinese experience what they did was they woke us up at  am put us in a little bus and we drove for three hours and when we got there we get out of the bus in the middle of what looks like a remote village and a little tour guide really happy way too happy for that time and he’s like welcome everybody are you ready for a good time and i’m like yeah and so he’s like my name is dang basaan and i’m going to be your guide today you will have an authentic balinese experience so exciting follow me and so we follow him and he walks up to a little door and i’m like this is going to be like a temple or cave… and he’s like welcome ladies and gentlemen to the real bali and he opens the door into somebody’s house this is not a museum house this is just a house someone lives there every single day he opens the door and he’s like this is the home of someone in bali  he eats here he sleeps here i’m like does he know we’re here  we didn’t knock nobody answered the door for all i know we’re breaking and entering right now we’re in some weird balinese gang i don’t know how this works and as i’m about to ask the question',\n",
              "  ' he turned and he’s like over here you can see the owner of the house he’s in the corner we turn and there’s a man the whole time just sitting there frozen stiff and i’m like is this guy part of this i don’t know if we should be doing this or should not be doing this and dang basaan turns to him starts speaking in balinese he’s like…  okay you can touch anything  and so i’m like i don’t think we should– before i can even finish the people in our tour group were like yeah touch it all  oh my god touch it all oh my god does he sleep here oh wow is this where he eats oh my god i could never do this oh my god excuse me thank you so much for having us oh my god i appreciate my life so much more right now thank you so much this is horrible can we take a selfie  thank you are you on instagram i’ll just put hashtag the man thank you oh my god so i’m really awkward right now right um… because this is like something culturally i’m not supposed to be doing as an african person i should not be in somebody’s house rummaging through their life so i’m standing in the corner really uncomfortable and the owner of the house is really accommodating he’s friendly you know he’s like yes thank you enjoy enjoy thank you and then he turns and looks at me and this was one of the most magical moments right because he was smiling at everyone else and his face completely changed when he turned he was all hospitable like yes thank you thank you  and with his eyes he proceeded to have the most indepth conversation with me that i’ve ever had it’s not like the eyes conversation was new to me you can have an eyes conversation with anyone you have a connection with it could be somebody of the same race when you’re in public er it could be like a husband and wife wives are good at having eyes conversations they’ll like shit on you hard you’ll be in public together and you’ll say something off– you’ll be like if only she did that she’ll be like hell no i cannot believe you said– but it’s just eyes i cannot believe you said all that wait until the next– you want to air our dirty laundry in public you’ll see how this is going to end you say this and enjoy this moment right now because it’s over and you’re like i shouldn’t have done that all with eyes right that’s what he did to me because one minute he’s smiling at everybody and then he turns and looks at me and with his eyes he was like what are you doing here so with my eyes i was like hey man i’m sorry i didn’t know this was your house they said it was an authentic experience that’s why i came he was like yeah authentic for white people you’ve got your own poor go back to where you came from  i was like yeah i shouldn’t be here man i’m sorry  so i left i go outside about  minutes later everyone’s done with their poverty porn so they come and join me  um… dang basaan follows the crowd and he’s having a blast you can tell he walks out and says everyone have a great time i know you enjoyed that now it’s time for a special surprise follow me everybody to the back and he takes us to the back of the house right where there’s this area they’ve laid out where clearly they have some sort of performance there’s a stage there’s raked seating he tells us to find our seats so we all sit down there’s people from all over the world in our tour group myself my american friends some british people there’s a french family a dad and his son they sit next to me so i sit in the front row and dang basaan comes back out and all of a sudden he’s wearing a giant balinese headdress looking really beautiful you know he looks at us and he’s like ladies and gentlemen are you ready for an authentic balinese experience please welcome the snakes of bali i’m like the what  i’m like oh he said snakes the snakes of bali– and i look and there’s snakes there’s a group of men gathering snakes to bring out to us and so i’m like yeah no no i don’t no because you see as a black person culturally i’m trying to not die so… i take all my stuff and start packing it and the french guy turns to me and he’s like  my friend where are you going the show i said yeah no the guy said there’s snakes coming so i’m going to move i’m gonna go to the back he said you are moving because of the snake i said yeah he said why are you moving for the snake my friend are you afraid of a snake i said yeah  that’s exactly what i am afraid of the snakes he said such a big man but you are afraid of a snake i said yeah with a big brain that’s why i’m afraid it’s a snake you’re not going to trick me into not being afraid of a snake my toxic masculinity is not so high that i’ll be like  yeah you know what man come on snakey come on  it’s a snake instead of just letting it go this guy turns he’s like i cannot believe it a big man like thisjeanpierre– he talks to his son  and this kid’s like ha ha ha  snake snake and he’s like oui oui snake are you afraid snake what is this it’s a snake snake and these two carry on for like  seconds nonstop right just back and forth snake snake snake the whole time he’s like snake are you scared snake i’m like whatever man you guys lost all your wars so i go to the back  right i don’t have time for this  i don’t have time ',\n",
              "  'for this because there’s snakes so i go to the back take all my stuff i climb up and i’m sitting at the top because i want to see the show i just don’t want to be a part of it so i’ve got my stuff i move all the way up to the top i sit there as i get there the show starts and dang basaan’s really excited and he’slike ladies and gentlemen please welcome your first performer the powerful python and a dude comes out with a giant python wrapped around him alright and this guy had this cool trick where the python would squeeze him really tight super tight so tight you could almost hear his bones cracking alright and then he’d make a sound he’d be like… eeh  and the snake would let go then it’d start squeezing him again and he’d be like… eeh and the snake would let go it would squeeze him again and he’d make the same sound like… eeh and the snake would let go i was like this is dope this is cool yeah we’re in a consensual relationship i like this this is uh… so he leaves with the snake the next performer comes out and this guy had a green mamba with him right and so dang basaan is like ladies and gentlemen the green mamba this guy comes out and he had a cool trick where he took the lid off the basket the green mamba would come out and it would start doing a little move and then someone would play music and then the snake charmer would dance with the snake they’d do the same moves like a justin timberlake video just the two of them back and forth i was like that was dope the snake goes back in and then dang basaan came out one final time he was like now ladies and gentlemen are you ready for the final part of the show please welcome the king cobra the final performer comes out with a cobra puts the snake down lifts the lid snake comes out and i don’t know what it was about the snake but you could feel the energy change like they were all snakes but this snake looked mean you know like it looked like it hated life there was something about it this snake looked like it had a mortgage  because it looked at us and then fixed its eyes on the charmer he was really cool and calm he didn’t even look at the snake he addressed us he was like ladies and gentlemen they say the cobra can strike faster than the man can blink but can a man move faster than the snake can think and i’m like oooh… i don’t know what that means  but i’m in because it sounds like a dumb instagram quote but i’m in and this guy had the most amazing trick what he did was he got right up close to the snake and he put his hands behind his back and then he would make it seem like he was going to kiss the snake and the snake will be no further than like a foot from his face and then he would make this sound like a kissing sound as he made the sound the snake would try to bite him and he moved away i’ve never seen anything like it but he leaned in and he’s like come on snake    too slow snakey try again   no love for you my friend come on snakey and all of us are enthralled every single one of us no one’s making a sound no one’s moving and he does it over and over again and then to take it to the next level he closes his eyes pouts his lips and i guess at this point the snake was probably like i think i figured this out this dude’s going to make the sound and then he’s going to move but if i bite before the sound i can change everyone’s lives because that’s exactly what the snake does  the guy closes his eyes pouts his lips before he can make the sound the snake strikes him pa bam  hits him on the mouth right cuts his lip open blood goes spraying everywhere now that should be the end of the story the craziest part of the story no this is the middle  the snake hits him on the mouth the blood goes spraying this guy jumps back and then acts like he didn’t just get bitten by a snake which makes us think we’re crazy because we all saw it everyone in the audience was like  and then he jumps back and he just shakes it off you know what he did he did that thing that people do when they get their hand jammed into a car door or something like it slammed and there’s a  and people will just be like mmm… he did that but with a snake so the snake hits him the blood sprays and he jumps back and he’s like mmm…  don’t worry we’re fine don’t worry don’t worry everybody we’re fine relax relax we are fine but we weren’t fine you know how we know this because his face started melting on the one side right so his face starts melting his lips start turning blue and he goes back to do his kiss trick again but he can’t even stand and he looks at the snake the snake looks at him and he’s like okay show is done goodnight everybody goodbye goodbye he runs off and all of us now are like what the hell just happened he runs off i have questions in my head like is he going to be okay do we get our money back how does this work and then we turn back and we realize he’s forgotten his snake  and you know what the worst thing was it seemed like the snake realized the same thing at the same time because the snake also watched him leave and then as we turned back the snake was also like oh shit and so now it’s just us and the snake and mind you there’s no barrier right there’s no concrete',\n",
              "  'there’s no glass there’s nothing it’s an authentic balinese experience so we’re all staring at the snake the snake is staring at us and then one genius decided now would be the perfect time to get an instagram picture and i don’t know if it was the camera the sound or the flash all i heard was click and the snake jumped up and was like…  and we were all like… arghhhh and then it was chaos pandemonium ensued don’t forget i was at the back so i just jumped i was like being black saved mei  i was out  panic ensued everyone jumps up people are trying to scramble trampling over each other the french guy was my favorite he jumps up and he was like sacre bleu  le serpent le serpent  allez jeanpierre allez and he’s pushing the people and running allez jeanpierre jeanpierre and when he turns his son hasn’t moved right so little jeanpierre is planted to the spot terrified and you see his face like papa papa he was like allez jeanpierre mon ami papa papa and so the dad realizeshe’s got to go back in and save his kid but this is one of those moments where you can seethe fundamental difference between mothers and fathers right because a mother would run in without thinking and she would be like i will die for my child strike me now snake right that’s moms dads will save their kidbut in the back of theirhead they’re thinking i’m going to save my kid but i don’t want to die i mean– i don’t want to die because this dumbass didn’t know to run when his dad was running i mean there’s a snake and i start running why wouldn’t you run at the same time now i’ve got to die for your dumb ass which makes no sense because i can make another one of you you can’t make another one of me i should just make you a brother and we can mourn your dumbass death together i don’t know why we’re doing this right now i think that’s what the dad was thinking because he didn’t fully commit instead he tried to sneak in behind his kid then he grabs the back of his hoodie and yanks him to safety so now little jeanpierre’s choking on the ground  papa and he finally gets him to the side another snake charmer comes running out grabs the snake puts it in the sack and finally danger is averted everybody’s safe everyone is safe but terrified some people are crying others are in shock i’m standing on the side watching all of this little jeanpierre is with his dad both in tears desolé mon ami desolé jeanpierre papa  and i don’t speak french but i know this kid was like you asshole you left me i’m going to tell mom  and so i’m staring at them and i guess they could feel that i was staring so they both stopped at the same time and they turned and looked at me and i looked at them and in that moment in that moment i realized we’re all human beings we all experienced the same thing we went through the same trauma no matter what happened to us before we are all human beings they looked at me i could see in their eyes what they’d just experienced what i experienced and in that pause i bent down and i got real close to them and i was like snake    that’s how racism starts but you know what it was worth it yeah it was worth it  i love traveling man i love traveling learning about places reading things and meeting new people i er… when i think about the history of racism– i’m fascinated by racism as a concept you know as an action a policy… all of it fascinates me i read these stories in history and one of the most fascinating things i read about recently one of the most fascinating places was a place called rochester new york where– genuinely this blew my mind they had a city which was basically dedicated to rehabilitating people who had escaped slavery so black people who escaped the south gone into the north were rehabilitated at this place frederick douglass wrote many of his works there the suffragette movement kicked off there it’s a powerful little place i was reading these stories and what they would do is slaves would escape from the south they’d make their way to the north get to rochester the underground railroad got them there and then they would rehabilitate them put them on boats and send them to canada so that they could live free and i was like that’s a fascinating story for two reasons one it reminds you there were a lot of good people white people out there i often get angry at white people then i’m like no there’s good ones calm down um… and the second part of it that was amazing was that they convinced black people to get back on boats i think  that’s one of the most amazing stories i’ve ever read because do you know how convincing you’d have to be to convince someone who’s just escaped slavery think about that for a second somebody’s just escaped slavery they’ve made their way there finally they wake up after one night of free sleep and they walk out and it’s just like hey man i just want to say thank you so much for everything you did for me man you know what my friend nobody deserves to live how you lived and i’m glad we got you out thank you so much i appreciate you brother thank you my friend okay all we’ve got to do now is get you some paperwork get you cleaned up put you on a boat get you to canada and you can live a free life everyth',\n",
              "  'ing will be better i’m sorry hold up er… yeah could you– come again you what did you say i know the paperwork thing is weird but we’ve got to get you some identification no you said something about a boat we’ll put you on a boat to get you to canada yeah no i don’t– yeah we don’t do boats no more i don’t know if you know our history but me and my people we took a cruise one time that shit didn’t go so well so yeah we’ve got to find another way to get to canada if you don’t mind but the boat is the best way for us to get there from rochester yeah that might be the best way for y’all but we gon’ walk hell we can run we can run real good we can run but we ain’t getting on no boat my friend you’ve got to get on the boat man i ain’t got to do shit i just got free imagine if i get on that boat and on the other side it’s the same what will they say to me ‘why’d you get on the boat’ ‘he was real nice’ hell no i ain’t getting on no boat you’ve got to get on the boat though you’re free now you’ve got to get over this maybe one day in a few hundred years one of my descendants named kanye west will be over this shit but i ain’t over it now  so i ain’t getting on no boat  we got to get you on the boat dammit i’m not getting on no boat and that was the day the phrase nigga please was invented   the white man turned and went nigga please i need you on that boat and that story was passed down generation to generation black person to black person free man to free man and that white man got down on his knees and he said ‘nigga please nigga please nigga please i ain’t never heard that phrase before in my life nigga please… nigga please nigga please i know that’s probably a phrase barack obama used at least once in the white house at least once like mr president do you think trump is because of you do you think you caused this nigga please just one time one time i know he used it actually i had the pleasure of meeting president obama while he was in office probably one of the craziest experiences i’ve ever had in my life yeah i was…  it came out of nowhere it came out of nowhere i was at the daily show i was in my office and i got a phone call from the administration and someone on the other end was like hi trevor would you like to interview the president of the us in the white house and i was like do you ask stupid questions i was like of course i want to meet the president of the united states are you serious and the day finally came i went to dc with my tv crew and they set us up in a room which was literally opposite the oval office we put all our cameras in place all we’re doing now is waiting for the president to arrive so we’re staring at the door with baited breath and the reason we’re staring is they don’t give you an exact time of the president’s arrival for his safety so they just give you a window like the cable guy  so we’re all waiting there listening to every footstep every moment and then he just popped in behind us scared the shit out of everybody yeah there’s a secret door but they don’t tell you again for safety right we’re staring at the door and suddenly he’s like hello i was like… arghhh but i had a great time in the interview with him he was really kind to everyone in the room and then we turned off the cameras and i promise you he became even nicer we just had a conversation i thought he’d leave he’s president of the us he’s got to go do something and he just chilled for a bit you know and we spoke as human beings and it went really well until he turned to me and he said trevor i’ve got a show that i’m doing in a few weeks a little thing i thought maybe you’d want to pop by and perform if you don’t mind i said mr president i would be honored just let me know when and where what’s the show going to be for sir he said trevor i’m doing a little thing for my aides and i thought maybe you’d want to be there i said i would love to thank you i’m sorry a show for what he said for my aides trevor i said you have aids  and then– and then he explained what he meant and i wanted the earth to swallow me whole  because i had just looked at the president of the united states and asked him if he had aids and the worst thing is that he was nice to me as well ‘cause i said that and then he explained and i was like i’m so sorry i didn’t mean it i don’t even know why– you said aides and then aids… because here’s the thing in my defense i get it now he means aides as in the white house aides the people who help the president i get it now but in my defense where i’m from aids is some other shit that doesn’t help anybody no one in africa is walking around saying let me introduce you to my aids so now i’m here i’m frazzled i’m like mr president i’m so sorry  i didn’t mean that you don’t have aids even if you did there’s nothing wrong with having aids there’s no stigma actually i don’t know what i’m saying i’m so sorry he was like trevor trevor calm down trevor trevor trevor calm down i’m so sorry mr president i shouldn’t have said that i’m the dumbest personyou ever met he was like trevor trevor i’m the dumbest personyou’ve ever met he was like no trevor that’s not true i’ve met trump  get out of here  so smooth i’m us',\n",
              "  'ed to it in life though this is something that commonly happens to me living in the us you know i understand it as an idea if you move to another country you’re probably gonna have to learn another language i didn’t realize that would happen in america because i speak english but here people speak american similar but not the same alright like small things change small things i accept that small things like pronunciation for instance the thing you drink i call that water yes water in american you say wadder right wadder yeah i say water because there’s a t in the word right erm… the glass you see yourself in every morning i refer to that as a mirror yeah alright in american you say ameer right ameer which is not the same thing to me a mirror is the glass ameer is a middle eastern man very different experience it’s not the same thing that’s just pronunciation right you also have to learn the meanings of words that you already knew when you move to america for instance where i’m from there’s a garment that men commonly wear under their shirts it’s white and it’s sleeveless where i’m from we refer to this as a vest okay i’ve now learned in american it is known as a wife beater yeah i have so many questions  and so the best and worst experience i had learning american happened to me when i actually first moved to the us i lived in california in pasadena when i first came to the united states right and the reason i lived in pasadena is because that’s where i knew my first american friend a guy by the name of david meyer he came to south africa to film a documentary we became the best of friends and one day we were hanging out in dave’s apartment dave’s chilling on his bean bag and he looks over at me and he’s like  trevor dude  i don’t know about you right now but i’m starving i said i think you mean you’re hungry dave he said what i said it doesn’t matter what you want to eat  he said you know what i’m craving right now man i’m craving tacos i said that sounds like fun let’s do it man let’s go to tacos what isn’t that the restaurant you’re craving tacos are you being serious right now you’ve never had tacos no i don’t know what tacos is  you’ve never had tacos my answer hasn’t changed from now dave no i’ve never had tacos you’ve never had tacos and by the way i hate it when people do that you know when people ask you the same question over and over again they can’t believe you haven’t had the same life experience you know that thing they do with everything oh my god have you heard the new beyoncé no you haven’t heard the new beyoncé no i haven’t– you haven’t heard the–  oh no now i have no i’d never had tacos right i’d never had tacos because in south africa we don’t really have mexican food we don’t have mexican food because we don’t have mexicans they never came over it’s not my fault dave was personally offended i’ll never forget he jumped up and he was like dude i cannot believe you’ve been in america all this time and you’ve never had tacos i said dave why is it such a big deal he’s like because trevor nothing says america like tacos  i said really nothing says america like mexican food and you know what’s funny is i feel like in that moment dave was being profound he didn’t even realize it but that was a profound little nugget that he had just espoused nothing says america like tacos i’ve had the privilege of traveling everywhere in this beautiful country i’ve been to places like erie pennsylvania el paso texas honolulu hawaii you know i’ve been everywhere and one thing i’ve learned across the board in america is that americans love tacos applause everywhere you go americans love tacos love tacos even people you wouldn’t expect i was watching the news one day and there was a guy at a rally and they were asking him about immigration and families being separated etc and this guy regardless of his politics he was being really mean and xenophobic and racist you know just acting real presidential and the journalist asked him the journalist asked him about children and he just went straight in he was like boy i tell you what i don’t give a damn about any of these goddamn mexicans they came over here they ain’t supposed to be here boy wooo it’s our country now you hear that’s right boy go back to where you came from wooo these mexicans ain’t done nothing good ain’t broughtnothing good to america we don’t need y’all come on bubba it’s taco tuesday get out of here but leave the recipes  i feel like there should be a rule in america they should say you can hate immigrants all you want but if you do you don’t get to eat their food  yeah  that’s a fair exchange to me you hate immigrants no immigrant food  and when i say no immigrant food i mean no immigrant food nothing no mexican food no caribbean food no dominican food no asian food nothing only potatoes  and i’m not even saying flavored potatoes i’m saying plain potatoes no spice because no immigrants no spice don’t ever forget that both figuratively and literally no spice and i know some people would take that i know i know people nowwho’d be like you know what take your immigrants take your spice and get the hell out of here you say that now because you’',\n",
              "  've never lived a life without spice but don’t ever forget a life without spice was so hard so hard that it made white people sail around the world to find it  and like…  this wasn’t regular sailing this wasn’t like a disney cruise these people sailed at a time when they believed if you went that way you would fall off the edge of the earth and die and still some man out there was eating some white ladies cooking and he was like  i can’t do this shit anymore i’m sailing that way but what if you die at least it’s exciting no immigrants no spice and definitely no tacos i know my friend dave would never allow that i’ve never seen him so passionate he gave me a speech about tacos like he was the heir to a taco dynasty finally he turned to me and said as your friend and as an american i’m going to make sure that you get tacos if it’s the last thing i ever do i was like why don’t we just go now he was like that’ll work you know what my favorite part of any conversation is when people think you’re gonna argue with them but you agree and they’ve already chosen anger because nobody just changes their tone everyone has to stick in the anger for a while because they think it makes them seem less crazy it happens in relationships all the time you’ll have a fight that’s not a fight you know you’ll be like goddamnit karen every time i ask for support you’re not there for me and it hurts me sometimes you know what bob i’m sorry no don’t try and– thank you very much i didn’t think you would apologize and so i chose this tone and now i feel like an idiot i’m going to leave the room and reset i wasn’t going to fight i want to have tacos let’s go get tacos dave so we rolled together jumped into the car and so we drove for about  minutes to what i thought was going to be a restaurant  instead dave pulls over into an abandoned parking lot  he kills the engine looks over at me and goes alright dude we’re here i was like where at my murder scene he was like no dude we’re getting tacos over there he points in the corner of the parking lot was a truck a food truck which i’ve learned is common in america some of the best food you find is on a food truck but at that point in time you’ll have to forgive me i was little bit apprehensive okay i wasn’t comfortable with the idea of getting food from an establishment that wouldn’t be there the next day  i feel like there’s a certain level of accountability that comes with permanence dave was adamant though he’s like you gotta get itfrom a truck that’s how you know it’s real i was like let’s just get this over with let’s do it so i hop out of the car walk up to the truck and it was definitely a taco truck because there was a sign above it flashing that read tacos tacos  tacos  by the way weird piece of trivia about me as a person i hate signs that flash but don’t change yeah i always feel like a sign shouldn’t be allowed to flash unless it intermittently changes to some other information otherwise i think that’s wasted suspense it should be illegal it always catches my eye and then i wait for something else like tacos and tacos and what else tacos anything else tacos  just stay on tacos anyway now i’m irritated i walk up to the truck i get therethis little dude pops out he was a completely different mood to me you could tell he popped his head out hey how you doing man  you want some tacos i said it would be awkward if we didn’t he says what oh yeah of course man of course but you never know maybe you want something else yeah i said what else do you have my friend he said nothing man it’s a taco truck i said oh thank you that’s a moment of my life i’ll never get back thank you very much he said no no no  calmate man i just don’t want to waste your time you want tacos let’s do tacos how many tacos you want my friend i said i don’t know how many tacos to get i’ve never had tacos before you’ve never had tacos i said no i haven’t you’ve never… had tacos i was like you should meet my friend dave because i’m not going to order food when i don’t know what it is okay i don’t know what the quantities are i don’t know what tacos are what a taco is i don’t know what a taco be what do you say how many do you get because if i go give me five what if tacos are like little pigs or something and i’m like give me five next thing i know i’m walking home…  and that’s how i started my farm i have no clue what these things are so i’m like yo man i just want to try the food just give me enough to try he said okay you just trying it out two tacos is enough i said okay give me  tacos two tacos coming up the guy goes to the back starts preparing the food i have no clue what’s coming out comes back a few minutes later hey my friend your tacos are ready i was like thank you very much yeah you want you want a napkin i’m sorry what do want a napkin and now la this is where it gets weird for me  because you see where i’m from napkins are the things babies wear  to hold their shit  the thing for your mouth we call a serviette but i didn’t know that so at this point this man turned to me offered me food and then said you want a napkin i said i’m sorry i’m confused wh– why would i want a napkin you know man for the ',\n",
              "  'mess afterwards   he said for the mess how instant is it that i’d need a napkin hey man you never know with tacos man one minute you think you got it the next thing it’s coming out it sounds like the most disgusting thing i’ve ever heard in my life he said no it’s part of the experience everybody does it man you make a mess you clean up you come back and try again you know i said that’s an experience i don’t want to have not gonna lie i’m going to skip it you’re not going to try my food i said i’ll try the food but i’m not gonna take the napkin man he says what are you going to do i say if it’s as crazy as you say i’ll just eat the taco in the car on the way home oh… you think you’re safe you’re going to be driving somebody swerves you hit the brakes splat it’s coming out don’t be a hero man just take the napkin i said alright i’m not being a hero right now i’m just being a grownass man okay if it gets really bad i’ll just squeeze super tight until i get to where i’m going he’s like that’s the problem some people don’t know they squeeze too tight then the juice comes spraying out even more it can spray on your pants and on your shirt… i’m like on my shirt how did this shit get onto my shirt is it just bouncing on the ground and ricocheting up what the hell is in this hey man you want the napkin or not i don’t even want your tacos right now dude so much stress now i love tacos    yeah i love tacos i love mexican food i love mexican people  i don’t even know what it is i think it’s just people we have a connection you know south africans and mexicans people from shithole countries we have this thing i still can’t believe the things donald trump says he’s such a– for me donald trump is an emotional paradox i’m not going to lie you know logically i can process him emotionally i struggle on the one hand i will admit i wake up many days terrified at the notion that he’s president of the most powerful nation in the world but i also must admit i wake up many days knowing he’s going to make me laugh there’s terror and there’s joy and i don’t know how to feel you know what it feels like sometimes it feels like there’s a giant asteroid headed towards the earth but it’s shaped like a penis  like i think i’m going to die but i know i’m going to laugh just look at everything that he does the world we now live in because of him you realize we’re living through history you know this will never happen in our lifetimes again we’re living through a time when we are all learning about the presidency at the same time as the president that’s never happened  how wild is that concept you wake up everyday reading the news and you’re like wow i didn’t know that and somewhere at that exact same moment he’s reading the same news going wow me too and nobody knows where it’s gonna lead nobody knows what he’s gonna do all we know is that he wants his wall he wants his wall donald trump wants his wall he needs  billion dollars the last time he asked he needs it from american taxpayers because mexico is smart  that fell apart real quick remember how confident he was at the rallies people cheering for him he was like  folks we’re gonna build  a wall  we’re going to build a wall folks who’s going to pay mexico mexico was like we ain’t paying for shit man  we might build it but we’re not going to pay for it man and if you’ve been following the journey of the wall but it’s probably the best comedy on tv right because now they’ve started building prototypes of the wall at the border because donald trump said he wants them to test the wall first i don’t know how you do that they’re like try again  and because of the prototypes donald trump now has specifications for the wall he now says he wants the wall to be made out of concrete but he also needs the wall to be seethrough alright and the reason the president wants the wall to be seethrough is because he said he’s afraid that drug dealers from mexico are going to shoot bags of drugs over the wall and they’re going to hit americans on the head as they walk by so he needs the wall to be seethrough so that americans can see the drugs coming and catch it  i’m not going to lie i don’t know what a seethrough wall is but at this point i’m just worried that a contractor will come along and trick the president he’ll take him to the border and be like there it is mrtrump your invisible wall  and then just to make sure he buys it he’s going to hire a troupe of mexican mimes to be like oh my god you can’t get through it  it works the mind of donald trump the other idea he had for the wall was he said america should build the wall out of solar panels that’s what he said he said america should build the wall out of solar panels because that way the wall would generate electricity and pay for itself yeah now i’m not going to lie that’s a good idea right it’s a good idea unless you know anything about solar panels or the sun or walls the problem with that idea is that the sun is up yeah do we all agree on that we still on the same page the sun is up right er a solar panel wall won’t work because a wall is like this so technically it’s facing down so unless you have a really swaggy sun that’s like yeah ',\n",
              "  'i shine real low b it’s not going to work for you the only way it works is if you take your board or solar panel and lean it at an angle to get the sun rays but if you do that you’ve created a giant ramp for mexicans to shoot into america just like ora le…  the mind of donald j trump the j stands for jesús a lot of people don’t know that  a lot of selfloathing going on there and he’s always going after someone right he’s always going after someone if it’s not mexicans it’s muslims if it’s not muslims it’s africans from shithole countries that one was my favorite personally because i am an african i have shat in a hole um… i also liked it because people came up to me and asked me questions there’s one man who came up to me after a show really concerned he was like trevor… hey can i ask you a question i said yeah go ahead my friend he said trevor i just want to know when donald trump says all these horribly racist things do you sometimes just want to pack it up leave america go back to south africa and escape all this racism  i said my friend you don’t go to south africa to escape racism that’s where you go to stock up are you kidding me that’s the one thing that reminds me of home the racism out here cause we’ve got tons of racism in south africa and don’t get me wrong it’s gotten a lot better when i was growing up we had apartheid erm and you know apartheid was basically the best racism in the world um sorry i didn’t mean to say that now you’ll feel badand be like our racism was the best no it wasn’t it was good but not the best  and i experienced a bunch of racism and everyone did i never felt like it was a bad thing mostly because of my family you know my my mother is a black woman a xhosa woman my father is swiss from switzerland and them being a couple was against the law and that was a problem for us living together and so we experienced a ton of racism in case you’re wondering yes xhosa is one of the languages with the clicks in it  but not like in american movies just so you know i’ve seen those movies where they have africans and they’re like…   that’s not a language even we watch those movies and we’re like… i wonder what they are saying yeah where are they from i think they from cleveland  it’s not just clicks the clicks are consonants we still have vowels i grew up in this family and we couldn’t live together i could live with my mom but my dad couldn’t live with us it was illegal and and… people would be racist to us all the time but i was really lucky growing up because my mom is probably the most gangster human being you’ll ever meet in your life nothing got to her nothing fazed her  i remember one day in particular walking through the streets together and some guy across the road shouted something really mean at us and i was about four or five years old and i turned and looked at my mom and i said mommy what do we do if people do the racism to us my mom said baby you know what we do if somebody’s racist we take that racism of theirs and we shake it up with the love of jesus and then we send it back and i was like what  i was like this lady’s crazy she was crazy but she was also right i didn’t realize how right my mother was until decades later which i feel is what always happens with your parents right they’re crazy and then you get to their age and you’re like oh that’s what it means i only learned the lesson my mother was trying to teach me when i was a grown man i was walking throughthe streets of chicago minding my own business some guy drove by in a pickup truck and called me the nword and i’m not going to lie i was disappointed mostly because he was driving a pickup truck yeah i just feel like that was an unnecessary stereotype that he didn’t need to perpetuate you know… i feel like if you’re going to be racist do something different think outside the box drive a prius  yeah it’s better for the environment and it’s quiet you can sneak up on me we both win but no the guy was he was driving a pickup truck called me the nword oh to give you the full story i was jaywalking i was jaywalking and i won’t tell you this to justify what he did i just want you to know that i’m no angel okay yeah i was crossing the road and then the light turned red for me but i decided to walk anyways because i don’t see color  oh my god and this man… this man was so offended by what i had done that he drove his truck around me rolled the window down looked me dead in the eye and he was like get out of the road nigger oh you could see he wanted to hurt me we locked eyes and i could see in that moment he was waiting for me to be like…   what that man didn’t know was where i was from more importantly who he didn’t know was my mother  because he thought it was just going to be a regular racist day  he thought he was gonna drive by throw the nword out carry on with his life he didn’t realize that that was the son of patricia stepping into the road and it happened in a moment but it lasted a lifetime because i didn’t even think he shouted that word and out of nowhere my body was like…  i was like oh shit this is it  and let me tell you something la it was so beautiful because i didn’t plan it i didn’t think abo',\n",
              "  'ut it all i know is i stepped into the road he drove his truck around rolled the window looked me dead in the eye said get out of the road nigger and i turned and and i was like yo my nigga  and he almost crashed and died  yeah i’ve never seen a human being question themselves so many times in asplitsecond in my life because i was smiling and i could see in his face he was like wait do i know you do i look like someone you know and i don’t know why he did this but i’ll never forget it he looked at his hands he looked at his hands like they’d somehow magically turned black like i had cursed him with a nigger bomb i don’t know what he was thinking oh… i actually felt bad for him man because i’ve been called that word before but that was his first time you never forget your first time you know i’m sorry i’m not going to– is that what he wants he wants to throw that word and my day’s spoiled that’s how it is he says nigger  he called me a nigger i don’t have time for that my mom always used to say she said you can’t control what people do to you but you can control how you react so i promised myself i said i’ll never give a racist person the pleasure of seeing my pain it may be painful may be hurtful but i won’t give them the pleasure of seeing my pain  someone says something racist i take that racism shake it up with the love of jesus send it right back don’t get me wrong it’s not always easy not everyone can do the same thing not everyone should i also understand that for me it is a little bit different you don’t i have a privilege in that i come from a country where the word nigger was never used to oppress anybody i mean we had another word we had the best racism come on now but not that word that word we had was a word kaffir so we have another word same thing it’s crazy to me sometimes same racism different word and here it means nothing right kaffir kaffir nothing some people are like is that like a probiotic is that what that is yeah the probiotic of my pain we don’t have that in our supermarkets for obvious reasons no one warned me in america i walk down the dairy aisle i was like yogurt ice cream…  this lactose is intolerant so it’s different around the world i get that you know it’s a privilege i have in dealing with the nword you know in south africa no one was called a nigger all over africa no one was oppressed using that word so that word has no power anywhere you go nigger nigger nigger… nothing whereas right now i can feel the tension in this room i can feel it some people are like goddamn it was that like  times i get it trevor that’s my quota for the year come on i get it it got me thinking that maybe we could use that we could use that discrepancy to help each other out and create a program where you guys send all of your racist people to africa just once a year because africans will roast the shit out of them the best part about africa is you don’t even have to wait get off the plane and there’s black people everywhere just jump straight in and be like nigger nigger nigger yeah and because africa’s run and owned by black people they’re not afraid of white people they’ll just be like jimbo he’s back the nigga man how are you nigga  god dammit i keep telling you you’re the nigger but you are the one who always says it nigga man yeah you nigga put on some sunscreen before you die nigga let’s go party  it would be different that’s all i’m saying it’s always weird for me i won’t lie because although no one used that word in a derogatory way the word nigger in south africa does exist technically right but in my mom’s language xhosa the word nigga means to give that’s what nigga means in xhosa that’s how you use it   so not only does that word not hurt me when racist people use it on me all they end up doing is bringing back fond memories of my childhood  i get flashbacks to when i was a little kid i’d be playing with my cousin and his toy cars i always stole his cars i didn’t have my own he’d start screaming like…  mama mama my mom would run into the room she’d be like  what’s happening here and my cousin would be like auntie…   she’d be like hey hey hey talk properly i can’t hear you what happened he’d be like trevor stole my toys and my mom would be liketrevor did you steal your cousin’s toys i’d say no mom i didn’t steal mom i promise i didn’t steal trevor…  don’t lie to me did you steal those toys i said no mom i didn’t steal anything what happened was his cars were parked illegally mom  and so i had to tow them because you can’t live in this society without laws i mean even me i’m just a humble civil servant at the end of the day mom without laws we descend into chaos mom if you think about it that’s all that’s holding us up as a civilization it’s the only thing that keeps us– she’d be like hey don’t come here with that smart mouth of yours give those toys back i said mom please i just want to play–  give those toys back give those toys back and i’d be like mom and she’d be like hey nigger  and my cousin would be there like nigga please  yo la you guys have been so much fun tonight   thank you so much for coming out and joining me i appreciate you all so much have a good night everyb']]"
